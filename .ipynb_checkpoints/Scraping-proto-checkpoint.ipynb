The gameplay is buttery smooth and the crossplay with Xbox players ensures that there is a constant playerbase to play with at all times. My queue times are usually less than 30 seconds for quick play and ranked play.So far, I have enjoyed this Gears game more than all of the previous titles. The new maps are gorgeous and The Coalition is promising that all future updates are going to be free. I have already played 20+ hours on the windows game pass and forsee myself playing hundreds more on Steam!Thanks Microsoft for finally putting gamers first and releasing a quality title for all PC gamers.')\n",

This is more an \"first impressions\" review, but I\\'m glad this series is on Steam after I had to skip 4 because my XOne was busted and dusted by the time it came out.The game\\'s run completely perfectly for me so far, no slowdown, and the keyboard controls work fine. It\\'s absolutely surreal to be using a PS4 controller for a Gears game, but thats the world we\\'re in.Gameplay is snappy, chaotic, and PVP is a blast but I suck beans at it. Horde is back, now with character abilities, and I actually think it adds some nice flavor to the gameplay, actually. 50 waves, and prepare to be there a long while. A new mode, Escape, is actually pretty interesting. I\\'d liken it to the Hunk mode from RE2, very limited ammo and you have to escape before you\\'re poisoned or killed, with two other buddies backing you up. It\\'s a lot of fun. Campaign is here, and honestly I\\'m pretty damn interested in the story so far! I always was interested in the Gears story though, and I know that makes me an outlier. But I think some people will find this interesting as well.I do have gripes though. I am NOT a fan of the PVP Roster which they gutted for seasonal, limited unlocks with the \"Tour of Duty\" system. It seems way too grindy. I\\'m sure they\\'ll tone it down but yeesh I don\\'t see myself completing the vast majority of this stuff, and it sucks, because the roster basically NEEDS to be bolstered by this Tour system. I think its a cool idea at its core, but I\\'d prefer it to be toned down and maybe find some special way to unlock characters in past tours. Maybe they will, I can\\'t say for certain yet. Another smaller issue is the online connectivity right now, it seems patchy and you might get kicked for no reason a few times, but I\\'m sure thats a pretty quick fix, so I can bear it.Also I loathe that stupid Fortnite-esque Store. I definitely prefer it to lootboxes, but damn Coalition, \\'no lootboxes\\' is not a high bar to clear, and definitely not something to wear like a badge.All in all, good game. Glad Microsoft is really being buddy-buddy with stuff like Nintendo and Steam right now, they\\'re definitely looking pretty alright. You know, for a massive corporation and everything.')\n",

You can only complete 3 challenges a day for the tour of duty, unless you pay real money to be allowed to progress. The microtransactions are insanely over priced. For 5 skins and a blood splatter it costs 25 dollars. A thumbs up emote is 10 dollars. Etc. In order to get any cool skins you have to pay, usually 10- 25 dollars. Until this is changed I cant recommend the game, unless you dont care about cosmetics. The servers right now are very inconsistent, expect to be dropped from matches very often. There barely anything to unlock and what is unlockable is very underwhelming. They just made it so you have to pay for actual good skins, which would be tolerable if the prices werent so high. I really hope they fix this ♥♥♥♥ cause the game has great gameplay. Unless alot of people complain they are just going to continue this greedy bs. Dont sit there are take it.')\n",

      "('Posted: September 9', \"As a longtime gears player the game is 'ok'The visuals are stunning, the campaign is nice, horde is still horde, escape is something new and different from horde, the game runs well, there's a lot of controls to adjust for your keyboard including the ability to separate dodge roll/roadie run/taking cover.Versus is where I dip most of my playtime and it's in an ok state but there needs to be a balance pass. They spent 2 years making a competitive balance tuning just to toss it out of the window in gears 5. They made the game more casual friendly but all it really does is make the game more frustrating for pretty much everyone. I'm hoping they make changes to that by nerfing most weapons across the board and making a nerf to flashbangs as well.My review rating may change - I wanted to make this one positive but I can't just yet because I'm not sure if this current versus tuning is here to stay or will be adjusted in the near future. For now you may be safer buying this game on xbox game pass for $2 instead of paying the full price and regretting it later because you may only be in it for campaign/horde.To go into a breakdown mode:*Footstep audio needs to be adjusted, you can hear people far away but people can run up behind you and it's soundless*Flashbangs need to be nerfed*Basically every weapon needs to do less damage, gnashers need to do less range*Spawns need to be fixed in TDM, you can spawn trap the enemy team*KOTH spawns need to be fixed, if you're in the current hill the enemy team will spawn in the next hill across the map, so you need to rotate out of the hill at 20~ points left*Guardian spawns need to be fixed (I don't think guardian should be ranked mode)*Execution should be a ranked mode*Markza and boltok are far too easy to get headshots with*Certain core game characters are missing from versus like cole train and baird, they will come later but hopefully no price tag attached*Aim assist needs to be an option for controller users, some people complain it's too strong and others just don't like having their aim auto adjusted for them*The new omen for showing damage blocks your screen, I'm not sure why this needed any changing at all. I've tried it for the tech test and for release and still don't like it. I wish it would change back. (For those who don't know gears shows a cog symbol with a skull in it to show how close to dying you are, in gears 5 they changed it to fill the screen instead of just being a symbol).* There's no way to tell if you're talking in-game voice chat. There's no indication symbol. On top of this if you try to use your voice chat key in a lobby it will do whatever action is bound to that key instead. For example I use the F key, so F key rotates your character - so in the lobby it rotates my character instead of using voice chat. In-game I have no idea if I'm talking at any point. (Some people told me I am though) and if someone else talks you can't tell unless you look at the scoreboard.* When typing text in-game sometimes the text never appears, also the default key to text is U, sometimes when you press U the chat box pops up and the letter U is inside as if you double pressed it when you did not.That's the end of my versus feedback, as for campaign I'm enjoying it - insane difficulty is annoying again where if you come out of cover for 3 seconds you get blown up in one hit but I guess that's expected. Would've preferred challenging gameplay over the game forcing you into cover but it is a cover shooter.Anyway if some balance changes come in the future my review will be adjusted - I play versus mostly so my review is heavily based off of that.\")\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGears 5 is an amazing experience. The game runs flawlessly and I have no issues getting high fps on my 120hz 1440 monitor. The gameplay is buttery smooth and the crossplay with Xbox players ensures that there is a constant playerbase to play with at all times. My queue times are usually less than 30 seconds for quick play and ranked play.<br/><br/>So far, I have enjoyed this Gears game more than all of the previous titles. The new maps are gorgeous and The Coalition is promising that all future updates are going to be free. I have already played 20+ hours on the windows game pass and forsee myself playing hundreds more on Steam!<br/><br/>Thanks Microsoft for finally putting gamers first and releasing a quality title for all PC gamers.\t\t\t</div>\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI've had a good time with Gears 5 so far. This is more an \"first impressions\" review, but I'm glad this series is on Steam after I had to skip 4 because my XOne was busted and dusted by the time it came out.<br/><br/>The game's run completely perfectly for me so far, no slowdown, and the keyboard controls work fine. It's absolutely surreal to be using a PS4 controller for a Gears game, but thats the world we're in.<br/><br/>Gameplay is snappy, chaotic, and PVP is a blast but I suck beans at it. Horde is back, now with character abilities, and I actually think it adds some nice flavor to the gameplay, actually. 50 waves, and prepare to be there a long while. A new mode, Escape, is actually pretty interesting. I'd liken it to the Hunk mode from RE2, very limited ammo and you have to escape before you're poisoned or killed, with two other buddies backing you up. It's a lot of fun. Campaign is here, and honestly I'm pretty damn interested in the story so far! I always was interested in the Gears story though, and I know that makes me an outlier. But I think some people will find this interesting as well.<br/><br/>I do have gripes though. I am NOT a fan of the PVP Roster which they gutted for seasonal, limited unlocks with the \"Tour of Duty\" system. It seems way too grindy. I'm sure they'll tone it down but yeesh I don't see myself completing the vast majority of this stuff, and it sucks, because the roster basically NEEDS to be bolstered by this Tour system. I think its a cool idea at its core, but I'd prefer it to be toned down and maybe find some special way to unlock characters in past tours. Maybe they will, I can't say for certain yet. Another smaller issue is the online connectivity right now, it seems patchy and you might get kicked for no reason a few times, but I'm sure thats a pretty quick fix, so I can bear it.<br/><br/>Also I loathe that stupid Fortnite-esque Store. I definitely prefer it to lootboxes, but damn Coalition, 'no lootboxes' is not a high bar to clear, and definitely not something to wear like a badge.<br/><br/>All in all, good game. Glad Microsoft is really being buddy-buddy with stuff like Nintendo and Steam right now, they're definitely looking pretty alright. You know, for a massive corporation and everything.\t\t\t</div>\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSplit-screen was removed from Horde, Versus and escape, 1 day before launch.  I love this game but can't help but feel lied to and disappointed as the Xbox version has this feature and I know Split-screen isn't that popular anymore but it's still the main my I like to play and to be promised it and to be taken away exclusive to the PC platform has left a sour taste in my mouth.<br/><br/>I love this game but I can't help but feel it's more of a stripped down version. Again I know this doesn't bother everyone but for people like me in the same situation I cannot recommend this game untill this is fixed or an alternative is in place.\t\t\t</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"bb_h1\"> Sum up</div><br/>+ Good variety of classic and new enemies in campaign and horde modes.<br/>+ Good voice acting with an interesting story to follow.<br/>+ Keeps the humor and atmosphere that defines the series.<br/>+ Great optimization, you don't need a beefy pc to get good frames.<br/>+ Characters are more than skins now, with load-outs to further personalize them.<br/>+ While not the best Gears game, it does enough to be a good Gears game overall.<br/><br/>- Microtransactions on skins are overpriced.<br/>- Few playable characters on the launch, and no Dom for multiplayer.<br/>- While it retains its humor and atmosphere, it ends up losing part of its original charm. Sacrificing that gory and brutal aspect.<br/>- The game requires Xbox Live (Silver) to be played and Windows 10 May updated to run adequately even though is released on Steam and therefore, should not need those.<br/><br/><div class=\"bb_h1\"> Introduction </div><br/>Gears 5 is the sequel to Gears of War 4 and continues the story following a new character, Kait Diaz. The game does a good job at being a Gears game even if it's not the best entry. Featuring four game modes (five if you count the map build) and more customization options for each character, it allows for a more personalized experience thanks to the load-outs and perks. With free updates and with the new modes such as escape and map builder, Gears 5 will become an excellent game in due time.<br/><br/><div class=\"bb_h1\"> Gameplay </div><br/>The gameplay is that of your average third-person shooter. You shoot enemies, move around the level and continue to do so until you die or finish it. What sets gears apart as a franchise is that Gears games had always excelled in one central focus through the years: Forcing the player to move from their position. To do this they introduced several different elements that range from options to consequences.<br/><br/>For example, some monsters such as the new enemies like Snatchers can incapacitate the player at a distance by shooting them with a needle from their sting, forcing them into cover. At the same time, the Snatcher approaches the player to execute them in melee combat. If a player is down near it, it can digest it, capturing it and complicating the situation further. Likewise, Wardens and Berserkers will kill the player with ease unless they are moving constantly. At the same time, melee weapons can eliminate lesser enemies with ease, which encourages players to get into melee.<br/><br/>Enemies come in great variety and numbers, usually swarming players. While moving too much can led to an early death, so does sticking in one place for too long. It is because of this insistence in making the player abandon cover that the game manages to not become stale, and it allows for more dynamic gameplay in the shooter genre.<br/><br/><div class=\"bb_h1\"> Multiplayer </div><br/>The multiplayer is solid and offers a good chunk of variety to it. Horde is fun as always to try to survive all the waves while building defenses and the combinations of enemies are an adequate challenge to the players while scape is a restrictive mode in which players barely have any weapon and must focus on escaping alive by the skin. As for versus, is just what you expect of versus, players fight each other until a team wins. It does feel good to chainsaw people through.<br/><br/>Another good aspect is that the future updates will all be free, with no season pass. The new maps all look great and some of them feature their gameplay elements such as passing trains that can kill players and enemies alike should they get on the rails. This creates a more chaotic battlefield while making maps play out differently not only in layout but also actual gameplay.<br/><br/>Players get cards for each character as rewards for leveling up with them or playing certain modes. With these, they can make their character better and have a better chance at succeeding in these modes. These are Horde and Escape. While some cards are shared among characters, others are unique to each of them which is nice as different compositions come together in the game.<br/><br/>If Coalition adds beast mode, it will further elevate the game. I believe this is probably as the elements for the mode are in the game already, all they need to do is just expand upon it and release it. New characters for the different modes are on their way and with these updates, the game will begin to shine and start to shine.<br/><br/><div class=\"bb_h1\"> Horde </div><br/>Horde is the game mode where players team-up and attempt to survive all waves. To do so, they each have an amount of money which they can spend on individual upgrades to their characters, defenses, weapons, or share with others. As the waves pass by, you will need to make choices with compromises on what you will upgrade and what you don't. Is that health regen bonus more important that a fence, or do you think you will need spare ammo for your favorite weapon? While these choices might seem inconsequential, they shape the end of the run with each decision.<br/><br/>Each number of waves, bosses will appear. These are can be pretty dangerous and will wipe the entire team unless they are fought with quick thinking and precaution. Enemies will also get a permanent bonus after every 10 waves such as extra health or bonus damage. Horde features higher difficulties to play in and each of them will, in turn, yield better rewards.<br/><br/> <div class=\"bb_h1\"> Escape </div><br/>Escape is a contrast to Horde. While in Horde the player is armed and can get a more solid footing with time, in Escape they are vulnerable. The match starts in an area surrounded by enemies and with barely any weapons while a toxic gas spreads across the level. With the gas on one side and enemies on the other, the players will need to move fast and aggressive as the goal is to escape before is too late.<br/><br/>Corridors tend to be close and the map reflects that of a maze trapping rats. Players don't know which way the exit is and must explore as they find their way across the layout. Enemies such as Wardens and Siren can appear and will, which add an extra layer to the sensation of being vulnerable and trapped. New maps can be created on the map builder and there are weekly maps to try out.<br/><br/><div class=\"bb_h1\"> Story </div><br/>The story follows Kait as she tries to discover the secrets of her mother and Queen Myrrah. It follows up after Gears of War 4 and explores the question that been asked through the series. Without spoiling anything, the story starts slowly but quickly picks up the pace and starts getting right to the point of the central focus. It is a nice touch that there is an entire act base on the premise of exploring, as it gives more freedom to take in the surroundings and do side missions which are a feature at some points.<br/><br/><div class=\"bb_h1\"> Some Notes </div><br/>The game runs well on any system that meets the requirements. It runs like butter. Frames are high and the optimization for Steam is superb. There are some extra requirements, however. The game recommends having Windows 10 May Update to perform well without any sort of crashes or glitches. At the same time, it requires an Xbox live membership(Free Silver). Sometimes the game can stagger for a bit but this is very rare and only on the campaign cutscenes.<br/><br/><div class=\"bb_h1\"> What Makes It Special </div><br/>What makes Gears 5 special is that it has a huge amount of freedom when it comes to dispatching enemies. Whenever that be by beating them up to death, executions, breaking thin ice and dropping then in cold waters, blowing them up or controlling them and force them to kill each other, there are tons of ways to dispatch them that are fun and entertaining.<br/><br/><br/><div class=\"bb_h1\"> Conclusion </div><br/>Gears 5 is an adequate sequel to Gears of War 4 and while it might not be the best Gears game, it is a solid with a good selection of game modes, free updates and characters skins that behave as individual load-outs, each with their perks and quirks. The current state of the game is quite good, and it will become fantastic after some updates.  This is a game that I recommend to everyone who enjoys third-person shooters, the Gears series and wave-survival games.<br/> </div>\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis review will be negative until the fix the cosmetics situation. The unlockable skins are just from the story and the grind to get them is insane. You can only complete 3 challenges a day for the tour of duty, unless you pay real money to be allowed to progress. The microtransactions are insanely over priced. For 5 skins and a blood splatter it costs 25 dollars. A thumbs up emote is 10 dollars. Etc. In order to get any cool skins you have to pay, usually 10- 25 dollars. Until this is changed I cant recommend the game, unless you dont care about cosmetics. The servers right now are very inconsistent, expect to be dropped from matches very often. There barely anything to unlock and what is unlockable is very underwhelming. They just made it so you have to pay for actual good skins, which would be tolerable if the prices werent so high. I really hope they fix this ♥♥♥♥ cause the game has great gameplay. Unless alot of people complain they are just going to continue this greedy bs. Dont sit there are take it.\t\t\t</div>\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAs a longtime gears player the game is 'ok'<br/><br/>The visuals are stunning, the campaign is nice, horde is still horde, escape is something new and different from horde, the game runs well, there's a lot of controls to adjust for your keyboard including the ability to separate dodge roll/roadie run/taking cover.<br/><br/>Versus is where I dip most of my playtime and it's in an ok state but there needs to be a balance pass. They spent 2 years making a competitive balance tuning just to toss it out of the window in gears 5. They made the game more casual friendly but all it really does is make the game more frustrating for pretty much everyone. I'm hoping they make changes to that by nerfing most weapons across the board and making a nerf to flashbangs as well.<br/><br/>My review rating may change - I wanted to make this one positive but I can't just yet because I'm not sure if this current versus tuning is here to stay or will be adjusted in the near future. For now you may be safer buying this game on xbox game pass for $2 instead of paying the full price and regretting it later because you may only be in it for campaign/horde.<br/><br/>To go into a breakdown mode:<br/><br/>*Footstep audio needs to be adjusted, you can hear people far away but people can run up behind you and it's soundless<br/><br/>*Flashbangs need to be nerfed<br/><br/>*Basically every weapon needs to do less damage, gnashers need to do less range<br/><br/>*Spawns need to be fixed in TDM, you can spawn trap the enemy team<br/><br/>*KOTH spawns need to be fixed, if you're in the current hill the enemy team will spawn in the next hill across the map, so you need to rotate out of the hill at 20~ points left<br/><br/>*Guardian spawns need to be fixed (I don't think guardian should be ranked mode)<br/><br/>*Execution should be a ranked mode<br/><br/>*Markza and boltok are far too easy to get headshots with<br/><br/>*Certain core game characters are missing from versus like cole train and baird, they will come later but hopefully no price tag attached<br/><br/>*Aim assist needs to be an option for controller users, some people complain it's too strong and others just don't like having their aim auto adjusted for them<br/><br/>*The new omen for showing damage blocks your screen, I'm not sure why this needed any changing at all. I've tried it for the tech test and for release and still don't like it. I wish it would change back. (For those who don't know gears shows a cog symbol with a skull in it to show how close to dying you are, in gears 5 they changed it to fill the screen instead of just being a symbol).<br/><br/>* There's no way to tell if you're talking in-game voice chat. There's no indication symbol. On top of this if you try to use your voice chat key in a lobby it will do whatever action is bound to that key instead. For example I use the F key, so F key rotates your character - so in the lobby it rotates my character instead of using voice chat. In-game I have no idea if I'm talking at any point. (Some people told me I am though) and if someone else talks you can't tell unless you look at the scoreboard.<br/><br/>* When typing text in-game sometimes the text never appears, also the default key to text is U, sometimes when you press U the chat box pops up and the letter U is inside as if you double pressed it when you did not.<br/><br/>That's the end of my versus feedback, as for campaign I'm enjoying it - insane difficulty is annoying again where if you come out of cover for 3 seconds you get blown up in one hit but I guess that's expected. Would've preferred challenging gameplay over the game forcing you into cover but it is a cover shooter.<br/><br/>Anyway if some balance changes come in the future my review will be adjusted - I play versus mostly so my review is heavily based off of that.\t\t\t</div>\n",
