0,Posted: September 10,26.4 hrs on record,"The Good:- Good optimization/Excellent Graphics- Crossplay with PC/Xbox One- Side Quests and Exploration in the campaign instead of just being linear and collecting collectables- Now has character skins/Emotes- Has quick melee (knife) instead of it being limited to certain weapons (ex: can melee with lancer)- Playable Jack and his new upgradable arsenal- Halo Reach and Terminator Characters- No season pass in the very beginning- Co-op in every game mode- Good Storyline and voice acting- GoW: Judgement stuff- User Friendly Tutorial- Horde Playable Characters have built in perks and loadouts- More than one execution for some weapons- Has Regular/Ranked/Classic/Social playlists)- THE GRUB KILLER IS BACK BABYThe Bad:- Characters you find in the main story are unavailable to play, including: (Baird, Cole, Paduk, Clayton Carmine, Lizzie Carmine, Oscar, Cog Gear, Onyx Guard, Nomads, etc.)- You cant earn any EXP towards your level in the campaign regardless of difficulty- Horde Playable Characters have built in perks and loadouts.... (No Classic Horde)- You can't earn EXP Offline, nor can you play Escape, Horde, or can customize offline versus against bots- No Arcade Mode for campaign- No fun mutators for custom games and campaign (ex: Infinite Ammo, Headless enemies, Lazer Bullets, make enemies stronger, etc.)- Wonky Ai (ex: dying in the campaign because Del decides to wait a few seconds before he picks me up or he ran to a far away location where he cant even help me)- Lack of free cosmetics- In-game bugs that make the game unplayable and you have to restart- Grindy progression system, makes it hard to get unlockablesThe Ugly:- Microtransactions- Microtransaction system similar to Fortnite- Expensive Microtransactions (ex: about $8 dollars for a spray/waving)- Alot of characters and skins, including the ones that are already in-game are most likely to be to be unlocked through microtransactions- You are required to do the entire Microsoft Account Verification featureQ:Was this game worth it to me personally? A: Yes, i played and love gears of war and halo for life and im glad they are coming to the PC. I would have liked it to have alot of the features that were in gears of war 3, this game is still fun and worth playing however. I just hate how its monetized, grindy, and has alot of locked content. I have to pay extra money to be able to get things i want, that should already be available from the beginning. The Ultimate edition, doesnt feel so ultimate.",179 people found this review helpful4 people found this review funny,Recommended
1,Posted: September 9,31.0 hrs on record,"Gears 5 is the Metro: Exodus of the Gears of War saga, providing players with new open-world segments while retaining what made the past games so much fun (frenetic action, amazing scripted events, interesting twists and splitscreen co-op). Make no mistake though, this is truly an AAA Microsoft game which, on top of having worthwhile campaign, includes a suite of multiplayer modes: Versus, Horde mode (now deeper with class-based system) and the all new Zombies-like Escape mode.The campaign feels a lot more tactical with the addition of Jack as a teammate, who can stun enemies, make you invisible, pick up weapons for you, and a lot more. It felt almost like playing XCOM. I REALLY recommend playing on INSANE difficulty so that you feel the need to explore all the powers at your disposal. They make the gameplay that much more interesting. This is now my favorite campaign in all Gears games and it also happens to be the longest.The game feels like it was made for both PC and consoles instead of feeling like a port. It's really well optimized and includes a game browser, and many video settings to help you reach that glorious cinematic 60 FPS.This game is definitly worth the money, get it if you can.",198 people found this review helpful11 people found this review funny,Recommended
2,Posted: September 9,7.1 hrs on record,"Gears 5 is an amazing experience. The game runs flawlessly and I have no issues getting high fps on my 120hz 1440 monitor. The gameplay is buttery smooth and the crossplay with Xbox players ensures that there is a constant playerbase to play with at all times. My queue times are usually less than 30 seconds for quick play and ranked play.So far, I have enjoyed this Gears game more than all of the previous titles. The new maps are gorgeous and The Coalition is promising that all future updates are going to be free. I have already played 20+ hours on the windows game pass and forsee myself playing hundreds more on Steam!Thanks Microsoft for finally putting gamers first and releasing a quality title for all PC gamers.",258 people found this review helpful21 people found this review funny,Recommended

6,Posted: September 9,16.2 hrs on record,"I've had a good time with Gears 5 so far. This is more an ""first impressions"" review, but I'm glad this series is on Steam after I had to skip 4 because my XOne was busted and dusted by the time it came out.The game's run completely perfectly for me so far, no slowdown, and the keyboard controls work fine. It's absolutely surreal to be using a PS4 controller for a Gears game, but thats the world we're in.Gameplay is snappy, chaotic, and PVP is a blast but I suck beans at it. Horde is back, now with character abilities, and I actually think it adds some nice flavor to the gameplay, actually. 50 waves, and prepare to be there a long while. A new mode, Escape, is actually pretty interesting. I'd liken it to the Hunk mode from RE2, very limited ammo and you have to escape before you're poisoned or killed, with two other buddies backing you up. It's a lot of fun. Campaign is here, and honestly I'm pretty damn interested in the story so far! I always was interested in the Gears story though, and I know that makes me an outlier. But I think some people will find this interesting as well.I do have gripes though. I am NOT a fan of the PVP Roster which they gutted for seasonal, limited unlocks with the ""Tour of Duty"" system. It seems way too grindy. I'm sure they'll tone it down but yeesh I don't see myself completing the vast majority of this stuff, and it sucks, because the roster basically NEEDS to be bolstered by this Tour system. I think its a cool idea at its core, but I'd prefer it to be toned down and maybe find some special way to unlock characters in past tours. Maybe they will, I can't say for certain yet. Another smaller issue is the online connectivity right now, it seems patchy and you might get kicked for no reason a few times, but I'm sure thats a pretty quick fix, so I can bear it.Also I loathe that stupid Fortnite-esque Store. I definitely prefer it to lootboxes, but damn Coalition, 'no lootboxes' is not a high bar to clear, and definitely not something to wear like a badge.All in all, good game. Glad Microsoft is really being buddy-buddy with stuff like Nintendo and Steam right now, they're definitely looking pretty alright. You know, for a massive corporation and everything.",70 people found this review helpful7 people found this review funny,Recommended
7,Posted: September 10,29.7 hrs on record,"Split-screen was removed from Horde, Versus and escape, 1 day before launch.  I love this game but can't help but feel lied to and disappointed as the Xbox version has this feature and I know Split-screen isn't that popular anymore but it's still the main my I like to play and to be promised it and to be taken away exclusive to the PC platform has left a sour taste in my mouth.I love this game but I can't help but feel it's more of a stripped down version.

8,Posted: September 9,14.5 hrs on record,"This review will be negative until the fix the cosmetics situation. The unlockable skins are just from the story and the grind to get them is insane. You can only complete 3 challenges a day for the tour of duty, unless you pay real money to be allowed to progress. The microtransactions are insanely over priced. For 5 skins and a blood splatter it costs 25 dollars. A thumbs up emote is 10 dollars. Etc. In order to get any cool skins you have to pay, usually 10- 25 dollars. Until this is changed I cant recommend the game, unless you dont care about cosmetics. The servers right now are very inconsistent, expect to be dropped from matches very often. There barely anything to unlock and what is unlockable is very underwhelming. They just made it so you have to pay for actual good skins, which would be tolerable if the prices werent so high. I really hope they fix this ♥♥♥♥ cause the game has great gameplay. Unless alot of people complain they are just going to continue this greedy bs. Dont sit there are take it.",504 people found this review helpful63 people found this review funny,Not Recommended
9,Posted: September 10,6.0 hrs on record,"Sum up+ Good variety of classic and new enemies in campaign and horde modes.+ Good voice acting with an interesting story to follow.+ Keeps the humor and atmosphere that defines the series.+ Great optimization, you don't need a beefy pc to get good frames.+ Characters are more than skins now, with load-outs to further personalize them.+ While not the best Gears game, it does enough to be a good Gears game overall.- Microtransactions on skins are overpriced.- Few playable characters on the launch, and no Dom for multiplayer.- While it retains its humor and atmosphere, it ends up losing part of its original charm. Sacrificing that gory and brutal aspect.- The game requires Xbox Live (Silver) to be played and Windows 10 May updated to run adequately even though is released on Steam and therefore, should not need those. Introduction Gears 5 is the sequel to Gears of War 4 and continues the story following a new character, Kait Diaz. The game does a good job at being a Gears game even if it's not the best entry. Featuring four game modes (five if you count the map build) and more customization options for each character, it allows for a more personalized experience thanks to the load-outs and perks. With free updates and with the new modes such as escape and map builder, Gears 5 will become an excellent game in due time. Gameplay The gameplay is that of your average third-person shooter. You shoot enemies, move around the level and continue to do so until you die or finish it. What sets gears apart as a franchise is that Gears games had always excelled in one central focus through the years: Forcing the player to move from their position. To do this they introduced several different elements that range from options to consequences.For example, some monsters such as the new enemies like Snatchers can incapacitate the player at a distance by shooting them with a needle from their sting, forcing them into cover. At the same time, the Snatcher approaches the player to execute them in melee combat. If a player is down near it, it can digest it, capturing it and complicating the situation further. Likewise, Wardens and Berserkers will kill the player with ease unless they are moving constantly. At the same time, melee weapons can eliminate lesser enemies with ease, which encourages players to get into melee.Enemies come in great variety and numbers, usually swarming players. While moving too much can led to an early death, so does sticking in one place for too long. It is because of this insistence in making the player abandon cover that the game manages to not become stale, and it allows for more dynamic gameplay in the shooter genre. Multiplayer The multiplayer is solid and offers a good chunk of variety to it. Horde is fun as always to try to survive all the waves while building defenses and the combinations of enemies are an adequate challenge to the players while scape is a restrictive mode in which players barely have any weapon and must focus on escaping alive by the skin. As for versus, is just what you expect of versus, players fight each other until a team wins. It does feel good to chainsaw people through.Another good aspect is that the future updates will all be free, with no season pass. The new maps all look great and some of them feature their gameplay elements such as passing trains that can kill players and enemies alike should they get on the rails. This creates a more chaotic battlefield while making maps play out differently not only in layout but also actual gameplay.Players get cards for each character as rewards for leveling up with them or playing certain modes. With these, they can make their character better and have a better chance at succeeding in these modes. These are Horde and Escape. While some cards are shared among characters, others are unique to each of them which is nice as different compositions come together in the game.If Coalition adds beast mode, it will further elevate the game. I believe this is probably as the elements for the mode are in the game already, all they need to do is just expand upon it and release it. New characters for the different modes are on their way and with these updates, the game will begin to shine and start to shine. Horde Horde is the game mode where players team-up and attempt to survive all waves. To do so, they each have an amount of money which they can spend on individual upgrades to their characters, defenses, weapons, or share with others. As the waves pass by, you will need to make choices with compromises on what you will upgrade and what you don't. Is that health regen bonus more important that a fence, or do you think you will need spare ammo for your favorite weapon? While these choices might seem inconsequential, they shape the end of the run with each decision.Each number of waves, bosses will appear. These are can be pretty dangerous and will wipe the entire team unless they are fought with quick thinking and precaution. Enemies will also get a permanent bonus after every 10 waves such as extra health or bonus damage. Horde features higher difficulties to play in and each of them will, in turn, yield better rewards.  Escape Escape is a contrast to Horde. While in Horde the player is armed and can get a more solid footing with time, in Escape they are vulnerable. The match starts in an area surrounded by enemies and with barely any weapons while a toxic gas spreads across the level. With the gas on one side and enemies on the other, the players will need to move fast and aggressive as the goal is to escape before is too late.Corridors tend to be close and the map reflects that of a maze trapping rats. Players don't know which way the exit is and must explore as they find their way across the layout. Enemies such as Wardens and Siren can appear and will, which add an extra layer to the sensation of being vulnerable and trapped. New maps can be created on the map builder and there are weekly maps to try out. Story The story follows Kait as she tries to discover the secrets of her mother and Queen Myrrah. It follows up after Gears of War 4 and explores the question that been asked through the series. Without spoiling anything, the story starts slowly but quickly picks up the pace and starts getting right to the point of the central focus. It is a nice touch that there is an entire act base on the premise of exploring, as it gives more freedom to take in the surroundings and do side missions which are a feature at some points. Some Notes The game runs well on any system that meets the requirements. It runs like butter. Frames are high and the optimization for Steam is superb. There are some extra requirements, however. The game recommends having Windows 10 May Update to perform well without any sort of crashes or glitches. At the same time, it requires an Xbox live membership(Free Silver). Sometimes the game can stagger for a bit but this is very rare and only on the campaign cutscenes. What Makes It Special What makes Gears 5 special is that it has a huge amount of freedom when it comes to dispatching enemies. Whenever that be by beating them up to death, executions, breaking thin ice and dropping then in cold waters, blowing them up or controlling them and force them to kill each other, there are tons of ways to dispatch them that are fun and entertaining. Conclusion Gears 5 is an adequate sequel to Gears of War 4 and while it might not be the best Gears game, it is a solid with a good selection of game modes, free updates and characters skins that behave as individual load-outs, each with their perks and quirks. The current state of the game is quite good, and it will become fantastic after some updates.  This is a game that I recommend to everyone who enjoys third-person shooters, the Gears series and wave-survival games.",19 people found this review helpful,Recommended

11,Posted: September 9,10.5 hrs on record,"As a longtime gears player the game is 'ok'The visuals are stunning, the campaign is nice, horde is still horde, escape is something new and different from horde, the game runs well, there's a lot of controls to adjust for your keyboard including the ability to separate dodge roll/roadie run/taking cover.Versus is where I dip most of my playtime and it's in an ok state but there needs to be a balance pass. They spent 2 years making a competitive balance tuning just to toss it out of the window in gears 5. They made the game more casual friendly but all it really does is make the game more frustrating for pretty much everyone. I'm hoping they make changes to that by nerfing most weapons across the board and making a nerf to flashbangs as well.My review rating may change - I wanted to make this one positive but I can't just yet because I'm not sure if this current versus tuning is here to stay or will be adjusted in the near future. For now you may be safer buying this game on xbox game pass for $2 instead of paying the full price and regretting it later because you may only be in it for campaign/horde.To go into a breakdown mode:*Footstep audio needs to be adjusted, you can hear people far away but people can run up behind you and it's soundless*Flashbangs need to be nerfed*Basically every weapon needs to do less damage, gnashers need to do less range*Spawns need to be fixed in TDM, you can spawn trap the enemy team*KOTH spawns need to be fixed, if you're in the current hill the enemy team will spawn in the next hill across the map, so you need to rotate out of the hill at 20~ points left*Guardian spawns need to be fixed (I don't think guardian should be ranked mode)*Execution should be a ranked mode*Markza and boltok are far too easy to get headshots with*Certain core game characters are missing from versus like cole train and baird, they will come later but hopefully no price tag attached*Aim assist needs to be an option for controller users, some people complain it's too strong and others just don't like having their aim auto adjusted for them*The new omen for showing damage blocks your screen, I'm not sure why this needed any changing at all. I've tried it for the tech test and for release and still don't like it. I wish it would change back. (For those who don't know gears shows a cog symbol with a skull in it to show how close to dying you are, in gears 5 they changed it to fill the screen instead of just being a symbol).* There's no way to tell if you're talking in-game voice chat. There's no indication symbol. On top of this if you try to use your voice chat key in a lobby it will do whatever action is bound to that key instead. For example I use the F key, so F key rotates your character - so in the lobby it rotates my character instead of using voice chat. In-game I have no idea if I'm talking at any point. (Some people told me I am though) and if someone else talks you can't tell unless you look at the scoreboard.* When typing text in-game sometimes the text never appears, also the default key to text is U, sometimes when you press U the chat box pops up and the letter U is inside as if you double pressed it when you did not.That's the end of my versus feedback, as for campaign I'm enjoying it - insane difficulty is annoying again where if you come out of cover for 3 seconds you get blown up in one hit but I guess that's expected. Would've preferred challenging gameplay over the game forcing you into cover but it is a cover shooter.Anyway if some balance changes come in the future my review will be adjusted - I play versus mostly so my review is heavily based off of that.",310 people found this review helpful39 people found this review funny,Not Recommended

17,Posted: September 10,50.4 hrs on record,"I honestly have no idea how Gears 5 is mixed. So I'm going to address some things that people maybe worried about because this game is amazing.The Ingame store: Nothing in the store gives you an advantage over other players. It's a rotational set of items that are purely cosmetic so you have nothing to worry about in terms of that. You do need to use premium currency to buy these items but there's nothing forcing you to put money on.The Tour of Duty: Alright, this system is a mixed bag. It's essentially a free battle pass where you complete challenges to progress through the ranks. The rewards aren't amazing but they are something to keep working towards. You need to put a decent amount of time into the game to get these items which isn't ideal as most people can't give their lives to the game but this system is absolutely fine.Bugs/Crashes ETC: I personally only had problems with connectivity during the early access period but all of those issues are near-enough ironed out. I have never had a single crash or blatant bug happen to me so this is subjective. I see alot of people saying ""THE GAME IS UNPLAYABLE I'VE BEEN SCAMMED"". No you haven't, troubleshoot your issues and look at your settings. The game runs amazingly smooth on my system and I rarely drop in frames.Split-screen: I for one don't use split-screen at all and I don't see why everyone is upset with their removal/changes to it. This is for sure down to the player.These are the main things I've been seeing and I really upsets me that people are giving the game a negative review. If you played the early access then you probably had alot of issues like the rest of us but they've done an amazing job to keep us up to date and continue to support the players to make sure we have the best experience in Gears 5. As a long time fan since the first game I can happily say this game is worth full price, it's an absolute blast. So if anyone is on the fence and worried about the mixed reviews...don't be. Give the game a try I'm sure you'll love the game!",5 people found this review helpful1 person found this review funny,Recommended
18,Posted: September 10,21.3 hrs on record,"Don't mind ""mixed"" reviews - these are angry Chinese players having troubles with their wonderful government's firewall.Game has improved since Gears 4, a lot. Much better campaign: instead of 10-12 hours of tunnel running it's now 30+ hours, semi-open world zones with optional quests. Better graphics yet there is much better performance and no stuttering on my i7 1070 16Gb laptop. Horde mode is better balanced i.e. it's perfectly playable for clumsy people with controllers (I've seen one in action, performed ok-ish). There are more customization options - especially that hilarious ""turd"" enemy mark, a must have item. There is a progression with cosmetics rewards. PvP / vsAI is a lot of fun. No bugs and crashes so far - except for overloaded servers not tracking multiplayer progression once in a while.One major design defect - which has basically killed horde and escape modes for me: characters are hardcoded to classes + a party cannot have duplicates so there is a chance you won't be able to play your favorite character in random groups. The game arbitrary change your class and characters, sometimes even when there are no duplicates.Surely, there are a bit better third-person shooters available yet this one is really good as well, you shouldn't miss it, it's 100% ""must buy"" either as is - or with a little discount.",8 people found this review helpful,Recommended
19,Posted: September 10,21.1 hrs on record,"(If you don't want to read the whole thing go to the bottom for a summary.) I have played every single game in the Gears of War saga thus far. As the game stands right now, I can't recommend it. I mean I love  the game but it doesn't feel complete and needs some serious work if this title is going to live the next 3 months. Also, where is my curb stomping? Was that execution removed or something?   The multiplayer is fun to say the least. Versus feels like how it should be. I played a few games of team deathmatch and I am very satisfied about the damage of weapons, power weapon spawn times, the selection of weapons each round and where they are placed. Seems fine so far.   I've had my fair share of random disconnections and crashes in the past couple days.That problem should be eliminated quickly throughout the next few updates.   One big issue I have with the game right now is the customization. There aren't nearly enough characters in this game to play as. What happened to all of the characters we love? We can't play as Cole or Baird? There aren't any skins for Marcus even though he's changed his look over the past several games. In the past games you unlocked skins over each act of the campaign. What happened to that? Apex Legends had a ♥♥♥♥♥on of skins for every single weapon and character on release. In the ultimate edition purchase you get a boost that allows you to level up quickly and gain exp to gain supply drops...but why is there nothing to get but banners, stale emotes and the same 3 skins for every single gun? I haven't played on the Locu- sorry I mean ""Swarm"" side yet and I really don't want to. There definitely needs to be more characters to play as. Not to mention that there is already a micro-transaction shop available...go figure. What can you buy there, you ask? In-game currency, emotes, character skins and weapon skins! None are intriguing at all. I don't know about you, but I don't want to spend anymore money after buying the ultimate edition. Moving on...  Horde:  I think these gamemodes are awesome! I've always loved horde since the day Gears 2 was released. In this game though, so far, I'm underwhelmed. Not sure if it's the game's fault for the amount of people leaving, but, man there are a lot of people that leave after wave 3. I may be the only one that feels this way, but I disagree with the addition of AI Friendlies for whenever someone leaves. Feels like I have to protect a useless kid or two, or three from waves of aggressive animals. The enemies are not my favorite either. I would go on to complain about the ""Flock"" and ""Leeches"" but they're already there to stay. I don't like them. Feels like they added it because they need to fill in a spot and have a reason to turn our robots against us. Must've run out of ideas for enemies. That's just a complaint from the ""I want Gears 3 back"" side of me. I do like the addition of abilities in this game though. An interesting twist indeed and a good way to make people fight over who plays Emile and Fahz. Also, apparently you're able to play as Jack, the bot. I tried to and have seem others attempt it but always get switched into some other character. So either we're all getting punked or maybe it's another bug. Lemme know if you know.  Escape:  Yes. I love this gamemode. Good. ♥♥♥♥ing. Job. You can make your own maps...double good job. I've always loved making custom games for my friends and I on Halo Reach, now I get to do it on gears! Not even going to complain that I can't do it for other gamemodes. Good job here! The only issue is the amount of characters. Everyone wants to play Keegan and Emile. Also, everyone leaves after you fail and you start right back at the beginning through the cutscene again.  Campaign:  The first act felt great and smooth. After that it was kinda messy. If don't you want  SPOILERS, DON'T READ  this part. After JD pulls the stunt with hammer of dawn he pretty much becomes a side character after that. I really dislike the path they took with the characters. It felt like the realistic reactions they would have but Kait becoming the main character and pushing the son of our beloved Marcus to the bench? Just...why? It made no sense to me. Maybe if he were in the coma for the time you played as Kait and Del but not after. That just made no sense to me. It only gave me the ""Woman Power!"" vibes in the manliest game franchise to ever be released. Remember how in the old games you were given the choice to take a path while your buddy takes the other? Well that's not in this game even though there was a perfect opportunity for it in the first act with the rockets. Also, in the segments with the skiff and all of the places you needed to travel from place to place in a desert and in a tundra, it all felt tedious and boring. Except for the storms in the desert. Either way those parts didn't really feel like Gears to me.   [/h] The ending: [/h1] At the end of the game, you are given a choice. Kait's mother appears as the Queen with tentacles and ♥♥♥♥, looking like she was tortured into submission then spliced into an octopus monster. Reminded me of Dom's wife with her face. The choice was to either take your knife and throw it at the tentacle holding Del by the throat or the tentacle holding JD by the throat. This had to have been the dumbest and most poorly written choice I have ever come across in a game ever. Of course I will choose the son of the main man Marcus. What decision is to even be made? Sure he's a hotheaded dumbass that's made some poor decisions, but they've all worked out, sorta. A much better choice than Del anyway. He's just an idiot made for comic relief. If he didn't keep reminding me he was near me with his constant complaining I would've forgotten he was even in the game. The choice was the crybaby, Del or the daddy's boy, JD. I've put some thought into it...there was a perfectly good opening for Kait to just throw the knife into her mothers face, but that just...wasn't an option for some reason. Even though before that choice was given, Kait screamed ""YOU'RE NOT MY MOTHER!"" so there was no reason for her not to kill then and there. Oh wait...gotta make another Gears game though right?  Anyway if you didn't read all of that then this should sum it up for you.  People keep leaving in Horde and Escape games. There aren't enough enemies, let alone characters to be interested in. The campaign was ungearslike and dumb to make JD the side character and even giving the option to kill him off over Del, the character that no one could care less about. They added micro-transactions which speaks for itself. We could've killed Kait's mother (again) but couldn't because money. Some crash and disconnection errors in multiplayer. Little to no customizations out there for the characters. Jack is apparently unplayable in horde. Where is my curb stomping?! The emotes and voice lines you can get are stale from most characters. That about does it. The game just feels like it's in beta, yet they have you pay $60-$80 for it. Also, DON'T GET THE ULTIMATE EDITION, its not worth it whatsoever. trust me just don't.",21 people found this review helpful,Not Recommended
20,Posted: September 9,10.5 hrs on record,"As a longtime gears player the game is 'ok'The visuals are stunning, the campaign is nice, horde is still horde, escape is something new and different from horde, the game runs well, there's a lot of controls to adjust for your keyboard including the ability to separate dodge roll/roadie run/taking cover.Versus is where I dip most of my playtime and it's in an ok state but there needs to be a balance pass. They spent 2 years making a competitive balance tuning just to toss it out of the window in gears 5. They made the game more casual friendly but all it really does is make the game more frustrating for pretty much everyone. I'm hoping they make changes to that by nerfing most weapons across the board and making a nerf to flashbangs as well.My review rating may change - I wanted to make this one positive but I can't just yet because I'm not sure if this current versus tuning is here to stay or will be adjusted in the near future. For now you may be safer buying this game on xbox game pass for $2 instead of paying the full price and regretting it later because you may only be in it for campaign/horde.To go into a breakdown mode:*Footstep audio needs to be adjusted, you can hear people far away but people can run up behind you and it's soundless*Flashbangs need to be nerfed*Basically every weapon needs to do less damage, gnashers need to do less range*Spawns need to be fixed in TDM, you can spawn trap the enemy team*KOTH spawns need to be fixed, if you're in the current hill the enemy team will spawn in the next hill across the map, so you need to rotate out of the hill at 20~ points left*Guardian spawns need to be fixed (I don't think guardian should be ranked mode)*Execution should be a ranked mode*Markza and boltok are far too easy to get headshots with*Certain core game characters are missing from versus like cole train and baird, they will come later but hopefully no price tag attached*Aim assist needs to be an option for controller users, some people complain it's too strong and others just don't like having their aim auto adjusted for them*The new omen for showing damage blocks your screen, I'm not sure why this needed any changing at all. I've tried it for the tech test and for release and still don't like it. I wish it would change back. (For those who don't know gears shows a cog symbol with a skull in it to show how close to dying you are, in gears 5 they changed it to fill the screen instead of just being a symbol).* There's no way to tell if you're talking in-game voice chat. There's no indication symbol. On top of this if you try to use your voice chat key in a lobby it will do whatever action is bound to that key instead. For example I use the F key, so F key rotates your character - so in the lobby it rotates my character instead of using voice chat. In-game I have no idea if I'm talking at any point. (Some people told me I am though) and if someone else talks you can't tell unless you look at the scoreboard.* When typing text in-game sometimes the text never appears, also the default key to text is U, sometimes when you press U the chat box pops up and the letter U is inside as if you double pressed it when you did not.That's the end of my versus feedback, as for campaign I'm enjoying it - insane difficulty is annoying again where if you come out of cover for 3 seconds you get blown up in one hit but I guess that's expected. Would've preferred challenging gameplay over the game forcing you into cover but it is a cover shooter.Anyway if some balance changes come in the future my review will be adjusted - I play versus mostly so my review is heavily based off of that.",310 people found this review helpful39 people found this review funny,Not Recommended

26,Posted: September 10,50.4 hrs on record,"I honestly have no idea how Gears 5 is mixed. So I'm going to address some things that people maybe worried about because this game is amazing.The Ingame store: Nothing in the store gives you an advantage over other players. It's a rotational set of items that are purely cosmetic so you have nothing to worry about in terms of that. You do need to use premium currency to buy these items but there's nothing forcing you to put money on.The Tour of Duty: Alright, this system is a mixed bag. It's essentially a free battle pass where you complete challenges to progress through the ranks. The rewards aren't amazing but they are something to keep working towards. You need to put a decent amount of time into the game to get these items which isn't ideal as most people can't give their lives to the game but this system is absolutely fine.Bugs/Crashes ETC: I personally only had problems with connectivity during the early access period but all of those issues are near-enough ironed out. I have never had a single crash or blatant bug happen to me so this is subjective. I see alot of people saying ""THE GAME IS UNPLAYABLE I'VE BEEN SCAMMED"". No you haven't, troubleshoot your issues and look at your settings. The game runs amazingly smooth on my system and I rarely drop in frames.Split-screen: I for one don't use split-screen at all and I don't see why everyone is upset with their removal/changes to it. This is for sure down to the player.These are the main things I've been seeing and I really upsets me that people are giving the game a negative review. If you played the early access then you probably had alot of issues like the rest of us but they've done an amazing job to keep us up to date and continue to support the players to make sure we have the best experience in Gears 5. As a long time fan since the first game I can happily say this game is worth full price, it's an absolute blast. So if anyone is on the fence and worried about the mixed reviews...don't be. Give the game a try I'm sure you'll love the game!",5 people found this review helpful1 person found this review funny,Recommended
27,Posted: September 10,21.3 hrs on record,"Don't mind ""mixed"" reviews - these are angry Chinese players having troubles with their wonderful government's firewall.Game has improved since Gears 4, a lot. Much better campaign: instead of 10-12 hours of tunnel running it's now 30+ hours, semi-open world zones with optional quests. Better graphics yet there is much better performance and no stuttering on my i7 1070 16Gb laptop. Horde mode is better balanced i.e. it's perfectly playable for clumsy people with controllers (I've seen one in action, performed ok-ish). There are more customization options - especially that hilarious ""turd"" enemy mark, a must have item. There is a progression with cosmetics rewards. PvP / vsAI is a lot of fun. No bugs and crashes so far - except for overloaded servers not tracking multiplayer progression once in a while.One major design defect - which has basically killed horde and escape modes for me: characters are hardcoded to classes + a party cannot have duplicates so there is a chance you won't be able to play your favorite character in random groups. The game arbitrary change your class and characters, sometimes even when there are no duplicates.Surely, there are a bit better third-person shooters available yet this one is really good as well, you shouldn't miss it, it's 100% ""must buy"" either as is - or with a little discount.",8 people found this review helpful,Recommended
28,Posted: September 10,21.1 hrs on record,"(If you don't want to read the whole thing go to the bottom for a summary.) I have played every single game in the Gears of War saga thus far. As the game stands right now, I can't recommend it. I mean I love  the game but it doesn't feel complete and needs some serious work if this title is going to live the next 3 months. Also, where is my curb stomping? Was that execution removed or something?   The multiplayer is fun to say the least. Versus feels like how it should be. I played a few games of team deathmatch and I am very satisfied about the damage of weapons, power weapon spawn times, the selection of weapons each round and where they are placed. Seems fine so far.   I've had my fair share of random disconnections and crashes in the past couple days.That problem should be eliminated quickly throughout the next few updates.   One big issue I have with the game right now is the customization. There aren't nearly enough characters in this game to play as. What happened to all of the characters we love? We can't play as Cole or Baird? There aren't any skins for Marcus even though he's changed his look over the past several games. In the past games you unlocked skins over each act of the campaign. What happened to that? Apex Legends had a ♥♥♥♥♥on of skins for every single weapon and character on release. In the ultimate edition purchase you get a boost that allows you to level up quickly and gain exp to gain supply drops...but why is there nothing to get but banners, stale emotes and the same 3 skins for every single gun? I haven't played on the Locu- sorry I mean ""Swarm"" side yet and I really don't want to. There definitely needs to be more characters to play as. Not to mention that there is already a micro-transaction shop available...go figure. What can you buy there, you ask? In-game currency, emotes, character skins and weapon skins! None are intriguing at all. I don't know about you, but I don't want to spend anymore money after buying the ultimate edition. Moving on...  Horde:  I think these gamemodes are awesome! I've always loved horde since the day Gears 2 was released. In this game though, so far, I'm underwhelmed. Not sure if it's the game's fault for the amount of people leaving, but, man there are a lot of people that leave after wave 3. I may be the only one that feels this way, but I disagree with the addition of AI Friendlies for whenever someone leaves. Feels like I have to protect a useless kid or two, or three from waves of aggressive animals. The enemies are not my favorite either. I would go on to complain about the ""Flock"" and ""Leeches"" but they're already there to stay. I don't like them. Feels like they added it because they need to fill in a spot and have a reason to turn our robots against us. Must've run out of ideas for enemies. That's just a complaint from the ""I want Gears 3 back"" side of me. I do like the addition of abilities in this game though. An interesting twist indeed and a good way to make people fight over who plays Emile and Fahz. Also, apparently you're able to play as Jack, the bot. I tried to and have seem others attempt it but always get switched into some other character. So either we're all getting punked or maybe it's another bug. Lemme know if you know.  Escape:  Yes. I love this gamemode. Good. ♥♥♥♥ing. Job. You can make your own maps...double good job. I've always loved making custom games for my friends and I on Halo Reach, now I get to do it on gears! Not even going to complain that I can't do it for other gamemodes. Good job here! The only issue is the amount of characters. Everyone wants to play Keegan and Emile. Also, everyone leaves after you fail and you start right back at the beginning through the cutscene again.  Campaign:  The first act felt great and smooth. After that it was kinda messy. If don't you want  SPOILERS, DON'T READ  this part. After JD pulls the stunt with hammer of dawn he pretty much becomes a side character after that. I really dislike the path they took with the characters. It felt like the realistic reactions they would have but Kait becoming the main character and pushing the son of our beloved Marcus to the bench? Just...why? It made no sense to me. Maybe if he were in the coma for the time you played as Kait and Del but not after. That just made no sense to me. It only gave me the ""Woman Power!"" vibes in the manliest game franchise to ever be released. Remember how in the old games you were given the choice to take a path while your buddy takes the other? Well that's not in this game even though there was a perfect opportunity for it in the first act with the rockets. Also, in the segments with the skiff and all of the places you needed to travel from place to place in a desert and in a tundra, it all felt tedious and boring. Except for the storms in the desert. Either way those parts didn't really feel like Gears to me.   [/h] The ending: [/h1] At the end of the game, you are given a choice. Kait's mother appears as the Queen with tentacles and ♥♥♥♥, looking like she was tortured into submission then spliced into an octopus monster. Reminded me of Dom's wife with her face. The choice was to either take your knife and throw it at the tentacle holding Del by the throat or the tentacle holding JD by the throat. This had to have been the dumbest and most poorly written choice I have ever come across in a game ever. Of course I will choose the son of the main man Marcus. What decision is to even be made? Sure he's a hotheaded dumbass that's made some poor decisions, but they've all worked out, sorta. A much better choice than Del anyway. He's just an idiot made for comic relief. If he didn't keep reminding me he was near me with his constant complaining I would've forgotten he was even in the game. The choice was the crybaby, Del or the daddy's boy, JD. I've put some thought into it...there was a perfectly good opening for Kait to just throw the knife into her mothers face, but that just...wasn't an option for some reason. Even though before that choice was given, Kait screamed ""YOU'RE NOT MY MOTHER!"" so there was no reason for her not to kill then and there. Oh wait...gotta make another Gears game though right?

29,Posted: September 10,3.2 hrs on record,"Nope,I has never play GEARS series and I pre-order into it after saw all those fantastic video and review. No doubt GEARS 5 stand tall and majestic with the mindblowing graphic and optimization! 2 thumbs and hat off for such a great jobs dev. Is rare to see a game that can run so magnificently smooth with such level of graphic details. I can run High/Ultra 75-90s FPS all time with Haswell i5 and GTX 1060 6gb.The GEARS 5 gameplay and system is the downfall of GEARS 5, it has poorly implemented multiplayer character selection system, only avail auto matchmaking and auto force assign character if same character was choosen. Imagine I only play Character A most time and the rest character is below level badly. It will auto force assign us to other character without selection option if other player using same character A. We're stuck with no skill unlock character throughout the game due to skill locking on character.The duck and cover system is real bad with KB+M, it maybe do good with Controller definitely not on KB+M. You can't run and side cover normally, the transition from run to cover left right turn is so bad, it feel like you're steering a car without power steering with 4 puncture tyres. It does a great job with front duck and cover not to mention those parkour and counter attack but turn left right cover during a run FAIL big time. Even with Division Duck and Cover it play way more smoother in comparisonEscape mode gonna be another one of the main downfall as well, all the player just ignore everything,horde everything,go F yourself and party priority is mad fast run and dash to complete game to get the exp meta. It literally become run and dash mode. When a non run and dash player join in it will be condemn to leave the room upon  bringin down the game and not playing the run and dash meta. This few feature is a grave mistake, look at the concurrent player, dun tell me about MS Store and Crossplay gonna cover all the low concurrent player on day 1 launch, The review of other doesn't do good either with all the server issue and such.Not to mention the crappy server issue range from rubber banding badly, lag,boot out and crashing, The one hated most by alot gamers is crazy expensive in-game microtransactions (Only sound good for rich,elite and die-hard fans) I dun mind microtransactions at all heck I even had plenty skin for Killing Floor 2 and Payday 2 but not at this st00pid expensive price point rate for GEARS 5.The most shaddy ♥♥♥♥ I encounter is upon exiting GEARS 5 it still keep on clocking the timer until I restart STEAM, it pop up a mini Do You Want To Exit GEARS 5 so my prior exit from game is not exited. I manage to refund after explain my issue and my overtime. I keep getting card even when I fully exited the game but the counter keep clocking and the game running silently.Hopefully all this issue could be iron out and no doubt by that time GEARS 5 will truly be one heck of a good game but for now is a BIG NO for me.",37 people found this review helpful4 people found this review funny,Not Recommended
30,Posted: September 10,31.0 hrs on record,"Gears 5 had me from the moment of launch. The first thing i thought was ""here comes the cole train baby"" and then i realised, you dont play as the OG squad in this gears either..... so my opinion dropped a little but as me and a friend played through the campaign the game only got better and better. Also in my own opinion this is the best gears of war so far (since the split from the OG squad). I enjoyed every moment of gears 5 and will be playing it again at a later date to collect the collectables and fully upgrade jack. This is a gears you do not want to miss. 10/10 I would recommend this game to anyone and everyone that has never played a gears game in their life. They truly have outdone themselves here.The greats about this game: Graphics are stunning, an immersive campaign, some of the best customisation in the entire franchise, NEW characters that you get attached too, an unbelievably great PVP system that DOES NOT make one person more op than another (VERSUS), a new mode called escape which is a little short just now but im sure they will work on that and last but not least HORDE, The good ol wave defense that slowly increases in difficulty and puts your skill to the test. Oh and i also forgot to say the game will be getting FREE content every 3 months and with that new tours of duty which  get you free skins and other cosmetic items. So horde 10/10, escape 8/10, campaign 10/10, versus 10/10. This game truly delivers the GEARS name and will continue to do so (hopefully) until the next gears. Yes, you heard me..... there is another gears on its way!The bads about this game: NOTHING but the people crying/complaining about the 4days early access because it had its own problems.... one of the problems was the servers and guess what.... you wanna know why they went down because SO MANY PEOPLE PRE-ORDERED THE GAME TO PLAY EARLY AND IT OVERWHELMED THE SERVERS....... so its not the games fault that its that good.Dont get me wrong, as a person that pre-ordered the game i knew it was going to come with some issues and dont get me wrong IT DID but did that stop a gears fan from playing NO and some people will cry and cry about it because they had ""issues"" on it hahah. Here is what i think of all the negative reviews: 1st. i pre-orderd the game knowing that it would have issues, but the people leaving negative reviews clearly have never pre-ordered a game before which im sure if YOU have you would know that the game isnt ALWAYS ""polished"". 2nd Be grateful that we are even receiving a gears game on steam as it once was a ""xbox exclusive"". Last but not least i am going to state one VERY stupid review and answer it for this person as comments are disabled on this persons review.OzarcDifficult top play or recommend, when the game keeps crashing both my 1070ti and RTX 2070 Super graphics cards with a GW502 error.Many others have reported the same issue. And yes my drivers are fully up to date.Why is it so difficult to make sure this stuff doesn't happen on launch day?My response: first of all if you pre-ordered the game, it had 4 days early access which didnt make it launch day and secondly MANY others have stated they are no longer having any issues with it anymore now that the game has been FULLY released.Do you devs not play your own games before launch?My response: O F C they do..... you are the type of person that crys and moans about the slightest little problem arent you? what type of person asks that question.... i cannot even imagine the type of person that as stupid as that. P.S Ozarc, this game was once an XBOX exclusive. Be grateful that we are even getting it and if you are going to cry about the problems go buy an xbox as i have heard they dont seem to be having much issues.",6 people found this review helpful,Recommended

32,Posted: September 10,18.0 hrs on record,"Gears 5 is NOT a bad game.Compared to original 3, it is a terrible game.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalWT8oNxhk - This video sums the game up compared to Gears 2 and it has shocked me how much they have downgraded a majority of the assets for the game.I got the Ultimate Edition for £69.99 and I played a few days before and it wasn't bad. There were a few connection errors but I'll allow it as its the first time its on Steam and servers and ♥♥♥♥. It also never recorder my progress through the campaign such as collectables and never updated my level for a few days. So I was stuck at level 2 for a few days - It is all sorted now and is updating perfectly.There's a lot of comedy throughout this game which is real fun as a lot of comedy in games seems dry, only game that really does it for me is the Borderlands series but if this is going to happen throughout Gears now, I won't complain.The graphics are beautiful, I'm running the game on High and it is amazing. Although the Microsoft Team have made the game look prettier, it seems they forgotten to add the substance to the environment and its just an empty shell.The campaign a lot of fun too, no where near as thrilling and entertaining as the original stories but its a lot of fun and definitely worth the price, especially with the new game modes and the amount of time you can put in on the multiplayer.Definitely give the worth",7 people found this review helpful,Recommended
33,Posted: September 10,31.5 hrs on record,"I suck at reviews so keep that in mind before you get the pitchforks and torches ;P Gears 5 is a wonderful addition to the series in my opinion. The story is taking a new level of depth, and still very much feels like GoW, but has some twists that give a breath of fresh air from the usual linear shooter formula. There are multiple points where they take an open world-ish ""RPG"" approach and let you explore maps with vehicular freedom, kinda like how ""Silent Cartographer"" in Halo Combat Evolved felt like one big open map, even though it was still following a linear formula. Multiplayer is a whole lot of fun too. Horde is still very much a thing and hasn't changed much (for the better IMO). They introduced a new game mode called Escape, which seems to work as a Left-4-dead-ish game mode where you only start with a pistol and have to make it from safe zone to safe zone. The other PvP modes are pretty standard Gears modes. KOTH, TDM, Execution, and so on. They also have a ranked and arcade playlist,  It is neat because they change mechanics slightly for arcade vs Ranked, but I feel like balances made in the previous games went out the window more or less. For example, in arcade mode, they limit how much you can mantle and roadie run to prevent dodge spams, but that is still very much prevalent in ranked. Gnasher range needs to be nerfed along with a few other random weapons but still feels good to play. I do wish that they had more themed maps like the Thrashball map in GoW 3. Controls and Options are fantastic, including things like a minimum frame limit, where it changes game settings on the fly to ensure you maintain the fps you set the minimum to (options are 30 60 and 90). It runs nicely too. Without the 4k texture pack, I can run e v e r y t h i n g on ultra and still get avg 88 fps. With the 4k texture packs, I run at around 60fps. This is with a 1070 TI, 6700k, and 16GB of 3200 DDR4. If you've played previous gears games, You'll feel right at home, and if this is your first than its not a bad one to start on, mechanically speaking. They do have the  ""State of the Universe"" and ""Previously on Gears"" videos, so if you missed a title or simply want to catch up on the happenings on planet Sera, they have these convenient little videos that will only take 10 minutes tops to watch. My big gripe is the occasional audio bugs that FREAK OUT for roughly a quarter second. this has only happened a handful of times in 30 hours of gameplay, but boy howdy did it rip me right out of my immersion.I have heard quite a bit about a 'massive grind"" but from what I've seen so far, most of the grind is for cosmetics. The ""grind"" for cards in games like horde and escape come pretty fast, have already leveled up at least 3 cards (some characters I upgraded cards multiple times) on almost every character, and that's only about 7-10 hours of gameplay in those kinds of modes. Super recommended! TL;DR if you like gritty third-person shooters, this game was made for you. Offers quality PvP, PvE, and Campaign options. Game is optimized nicely and has an arsenal of options compared to other Microsoft titles on PC. PS:  if you're unsure whether you'll like it, Microsoft's Game Pass Ultimate has Gears 5 included, so for $2 you can test it out and see if its worth full price to you!",4 people found this review helpful,Recommended

35,Posted: September 10,29.0 hrs on record,"Gears 5 is a fundamentally great game for several reasons, but I can't recommend it in its launch state. It is within the realm of being patched into greatness, but it is sad to see a game release like this. I'll try and briefly touch on each aspect of the game I've experienced and how I feel about it.- The general feel of the game is amazing. If you miss when Gears felt at its fastest and most furious, Gears 5 is very much a return to that weighty, impactful style of movement and gunplay with enough speed to keep everything intense. Each gun looks and sounds great, there's a pretty decent variety of them, and the locales you visit are pretty stunning. It altogether feels like an improvement in most of the little ways that help Gears feel like Gears. How good the game feels to play is perhaps the most standout positive aspect of the game; it reminds me of when I first experienced Gears of War 3 and how much of an improvement it felt over the prior games. This is all very prevalent in the fantastic multiplayer experience, which stands to be one of the best the series has ever had. I have an enormous amount of fun playing Gears 5 when its several imperfections aren't taken into consideration, and the general gameplay experience is wonderful.- The state of cosmetics and microtransactions is atrocious. While some character skins and weapon skins are reasonably priced, even this early into the ""daily store"" it is clear to see the microtransactions name to nickle and dime people with incredibly expensive emotes that are locked to single characters, blood splatter effects being hard to notice in-game, and several items being sold in packs, forcing you to potentially buy more than you're interested in. This is all severely compounded by the lack of skins available to earn ""normally"" through gameplay; you will no longer earn new characters/skins by leveling up in the multiplayer or completing gameplay achievements, or even by opening lootboxes accrued from gameplay time. No, instead you'll either have to pay or complete challenges inside of the game's ""battle pass"" system, the Tour of Duty. Everything in the Tour takes an enormous amount of time to accomplish and rewards the player very little for their time compared to previous installments--expect to play 30 or so hours of Horde if you'd like those rewards. There are several notable absences for multiplayer character selection too--no Carmines, no Cole, no Baird, etcetera. All of this adds together to an experience which doesn't do much to reward you for your time spent like in previous games.- There was advertised split-screen for several gamemodes in Gears 5, which is functional in-game, and pulled from the release version of the game. Gears of War 4 had to drop split-screen compatibility for several gamemodes due to technical reasons, but Gears 5 advertised that it would include split-screen for the multiplayer, Horde, and Escape gamemodes. In the pre-release version of the game, it was apparently possible to play split-screen in those modes just fine, but when the game was pulled from its early release state the ability to play those modes in split-screen has been mysteriously removed, meaning that only the campaign can be played in split-screen (all of the other modes are available in split-screen on console to my knowledge, and worked on the PC version).  In my case, I purchased the game in large part due to the opportunity to play split-screen Horde with friends, something I sorely found missing in 4. This blatant bait-and-switch on the developers fault feels insulting, especially in light of it clearly being implemented on PC already and removed without explanation. Since this was clearly advertised prior to release, and only announced during the pre-release period that it would be changing, I feel that my trust has been betrayed and that I purchased a product that was not as advertised. While most users likely care little about this, I think it is a big deal that The Coalition changed this so close to release, and biases my opinion on the game fairly heavily. The article written by PC Invasion talks about the topic (can't link here), and includes the developer response.- Horde and Escape are clearly unfinished. Horde is very poorly balanced with skills so useless they are never worth considering (an ammo regen perk sounds nice, until you fully upgrade it and realize it still takes 3 minutes to regenerate a single assault rifle magazine) and next to no new additions from previous iterations. Thankfully, the enemy variation is pretty solid and the tried and true gameplay mostly holds up (balancing issues are perhaps the biggest complaint I can level at Horde--the new difficulty modes are also arguably less fun to deal with since they introduce new rules). Escape is cool, but the Beta Level Editor is so unbelievably barebones that it isn't even worth experimenting with--there are only 5 enemy types that you can place at launch, which is absolutely insufficient diversity for creating anything worthwhile. The developers have announced that several changes to this mode will be coming, and the developer-created maps are of a higher standard that we can hope to eventually expect of player-created ones, but the tool has launched in a completely pointless state. On top of the limited enemy diversity, there're very few themes to pick from in the editor (mostly mines) and the point restrictions are such that player-created areas seem to be incapable of reaching the detail that developer ones do. Again, this can all be changed, but it has not launched in a great state. The existing Escape missions created by the devs are fun though, at least, and the mode shows a lot of promise as a unique way to enjoy Gears 5.- There have been several connectivity issues across the multiplayer over the pre-release period. It's improved over said period but is still persistent. I think this will improve relatively soon but it's another aspect of this game that was not ready for launch.- The campaign is apparently very good. I haven't played it yet but most reviewers are describing it as the highlight of the experience. I'll give the game the benefit of the doubt and assume that the campaign is amazing for now, and update my review when I've played it. Others do suggest that the game is worth buying for the campaign experience alone, so take that for what you will. My interest in Gears revolves mostly around competitive multiplayer and casual Horde; competitive multiplayer is pretty good while my ability to play Horde split-screen has been totally removed.- The game runs really well for me. Other people are reporting several problems, but if you're like me and are willing to turn down your graphics a bit, the game will keep whatever FPS you like without stressing your hardware too much. It can look absolutely gorgeous too if your rig can handle it. Some users are reporting major graphical bugs, but that seems like a minority.All-in-all, I really like the game, but there're some major flaws that prevent me from recommending it. The biggest one and the most insulting for me personally is how they removed several seemingly functional split-screen components of the multiplayer that they had advertised prior, but I understand that this isn't as big of a deal for many. The problematic microtransactions, half-baked Horde and Escape experiences, unrewarding multiplayer progression, connection issues, and bugs might prove a bigger issue, however. I think the game will likely be improved enough in the next several months to be an easy recommendation, but it doesn't deserve a recommendation in it's release state. I'm also ♥♥♥♥♥♥ about split-screen.",6 people found this review helpful,Not Recommended

There was nothing but intense connection fails, even when playing private games, because one must always be connected to the server inorder to play with friends. -Not to mention- (but gonna anyways)I have done 2 separate support requests with Microsoft due to a failure in me receiving the DLC i paid for!

I have also yet to receive my Gears of War 4 Esports Supporter Banner.There is also a major issue with code redemptions, for Owners of Gears 5 via Steam, of which i mean that inorder to receive the content for stuff like Gears 5 Rockstar codes you have to log into the Xbox and launch the game first inorder to receive it, yet you dont if you own it through the Microsoft Store (cause play anywhere) Steam doesn't get play anywhere and thus cant launch through the Xbox, despite the fact code redemptions are/can be done online.",13 people found this review helpful,Not Recommended

45,Posted: September 9,35.5 hrs on record,"I've been playing Gears for nearly a decade now, but I never thought I'd see any of the games in my Steam library. Thank you, Microsoft, for finally returning to PC gaming and doing it correctly.In terms of presentation, this is AAA at its best. Not the ultra-realism of Call of Duty, but the real video game look and feel of money being allocated correctly. The game is, to put it plainly, drop-dead gorgeous. There isn't a lot to say beyond ""It just looks ♥♥♥♥ing awesome."" Audio design is spot-on with a lot of weapon sounds being updated to sound a lot more realistic. The score, provided by Game of Thrones composer Ramin Djawadi, stands out in its own right from the soundtrack of the original trilogy, with less bombast suiting the more down-to-earth tone of The Coalition's titles.I was lukewarm on Gears 4's story, though it did have some nice stuff. I'll always compare any game in the series to Gears 3, which was the high point for me. Gears 5, thankfully, is a huge step up in quality and has been handled really well by The Coalition. I felt that the story was a good mixture of quiet downtime, impressive setpieces and strong emotional beats. The somewhat generic feeling of the new characters has been hammered out and they're much more interesting now. I especially liked JD's moral complexity and realistic representation of being an officer in a difficult situation. Del remains the only lackluster character in my opinion, being just kind of... empty, in my opinion. The voice acting, as ever, is top-notch and Laura Bailey delivers a great performance as main character Kait.Horde mode is where the meat is at for myself and many other players and it does not disappoint. The limited character pool hurts it somewhat, but that is likely to be remedied by the future addition of more characters. The specialised skills and equipment of different characters is a nice change of pace and adds a lot of replayability. I've had an especially good time with Fahz, a headshot machine who fills one's ears with the constant, satisfying pop of heads receiving high-caliber rounds from across the map.Escape and Versus are the only modes I haven't tried yet, mainly due to matchmaking difficulties. I would chalk this up to overloaded servers and the smaller playerbase for early-access. I hope that they hold up as well as the rest of the game does.On the whole, Gears 5 is the best the series has been since Gears 3 and a very promising step up for the development team behind it. Hopefully, the planned post-launch support will continue to maintain this high standard set for the game. Excellent work.",6 people found this review helpful,Recommended

Oh don't forget that the enemies that can insta gib you get shield drones that merge with walls so you have to wait for the game to unstuck itself so you sit there holding on for dear life as you are bent over because you literally can't shoot the enemy hiding inside walls. Don't even get me started on the microtransactions and the grind to get literally anything in gears 5.This game also has one of the single most infuriating boss fights that is filled with unfair mechanics that sometimes don't even work. one error no matter how minor it may seem will end your life and you will have to start over.

Online as usual is great fun, but many are complaining of errors, which I have encountered sometimes too, hopefully it's fixed ASAP.Overall, this game is awesome and 100% worth your time. It even has timely operations now, which will keep the game as fresh as possible, which is pretty cool. Insane difficulty is ruthless, you need to be a mad pro for that difficulty and make every shot count.Story 8/10Graphics 10/10Gameplay 8/10 (should fix the hitches ASAP)Note: Marcus Fenix is still a BADASS!",5 people found this review helpful,Recommended

81,Posted: September 9,38.1 hrs on record,"Overall a very hard choice for me, solid action packed campaign, revamped horde mode, escape mode, good PvP modes, very well optimized, game looks and sounds gorgeous.  My one complaint is that I think weapons skins are going to mostly bought on the store because there are not many earned in the tour unless I am missing something. Great game, but plagued with daily & weekly micro transactions therefore not giving you much to earn in the tour other than blood stain decals, player icons, emotes, and executions (executions was a nice touch though).I can't recommend right now because as an old Gears 1, 2, & 3 player the content to grind for isn't that great and mostly store focused for cool skins. Other than that I love the game.",18 people found this review helpful1 person found this review funny,Not Recommended
82,Posted: September 10,6.6 hrs on record,"So far, I'm loving this game, but some things to be aware of: There are pretty hefty cosmetic microtransactions, so if you like looking stylish, be aware, and beware. It's extremely always online, even for single-player campaign. Can't sign in with Xbox Live? Ya can't play the game. The first time I booted it up, the Xbox Live servers were down, so I just had to go do something else for 8 hours until they were back. (Oh boy, does that bring back some lovely Games for Windows Live flashbacks) The campaign AI is sometimes great, sometimes dumb as a sack of bricks and potatoes: Great if you want mashed potatoes, but not much else.That said, this was my intro to the Gears of War series (never owned an Xbox) and it's been a blast. The characters are charmingly well written. (Except you Fahz) The gameplay feels polished and smooth. It's beautiful to look at. And the fact that they made JACK playable in such a unique and entertaining way is really awesome. Props to the dev team, but the microtransactions and always-online singleplayer really do put a bit of a damper on things. Still, I'd recommend picking this up. It's tons of fun by yourself, or with friends. I haven't given the PVP or Escape a try yet, because in all honesty, that's not the main reason I bought the game. The campaign was, and the campaign is worth it in my opinion.",1 person found this review helpful,Recommended

The lack of playable characters on launch is very lack luster but the lack of LOOT BOXES is a step in the right direction. The game is going the live service route with a built in FREE battle pass that at the moment doesn't garner much replayability. The server stability is here and there but they've been quick to patches and hot fixes. The game needs tweeks and fixes but its all around a good package.

92,Posted: September 10,15.6 hrs on record,"I want to start this review off by saying that I have been a Gears series fan since the very first game was announced on the Xbox. One of the primary reasons I had kept a console in the house was for the purpose of playing Gears of War.Playing the game on ultra is a beautiful experience that is both smooth and visually appealing (if you have the hardware to allow it). One of the biggest positive tech points between Gears 4 and 5 is that this PC adaption of the game does not feel like it was simply a thrown together console port. The game runs well and gives a polished feel that was almost as if it was a version made specifically for PC, the ability to purchase this on the steam platform as opposed to the Microsoft Store (Gears 4 and the other games in the series) is a huge plus. As far as ports go, this is how it should be done.The story itself is captivating and an amazing continuation of not only the existing story Arc of Gears 4 but the entire series. With that being said, Gears 5 completely can stand on its own two feet as an introduction into the series for those who have no previous experience with the games. The voice acting is amazing and vivid, the narrative gives us a reason to care about what happens to these Gears as they traverse the war torn scapes of Sera. I have always found that I held an emotional investment into the progression and outcomes of the characters in the Gears series and that is in part due to the story telling.In addition to amazing cut scenes and conversations between our Gears in the world, there is a plethora of lore to be collected around in the world in the way of COG tags, notes, journal entries, etc. I also want to touch base on the new open world style approach during the various acts. It is an amazing feeling as a Gears fan to be able to explore the world beyond the set pieces, the addition of optional side quests to break up the main story is refreshing and gives us more time to enjoy this world.As of writing this, I have not spent much time with the multiplayer as my focus during my time with the early access has been playing through the single player campaign. However, I did enjoy Horde Mode as a break between the story and it is exactly what you want and expect out of Horde mode. For me, this is a 10/10 entry in the Gears series and I am excited to see where we go from here.",1 person found this review helpful,Recommended

110,Posted: September 10,24.3 hrs on record,"I'll start with the one jarring issue I've had with Gears 5, and it's something that appears pretty widespread - the surround settings for my headset don't seem to work with it, you'll find that any voices in front of your character appear muffled and pretty much inaudible, so when it comes to the Campaign, I basically had to just play without a headset and use my actual speakers. I've also had a popup pretty much every time I launch the game warning about my GPU having 'known issues', but I can honestly say - that I'm yet to encounter anything weird, other than a brief stutter at the start of cutscenes.A lot of people have also mentioned micro-transactions, but they're basically just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ skins. I mean, yeah - they're pretty expensive, but - if someone wants to be a dumbass and buy some skins, sure? I guess? I really don't care - it's not impactful on gameplay and I think a lot of people are just looking for reasons to be mad, more than anything.With that out the way, I honestly cannot recommend Gears 5 enough, It's been out just over a day, and I've already sunk a ridiculous amount of time into the game - at this point, having played, I think at least a little bit of every Versus gamemode, having done some of the early Hive acts and played Horde through to about wave 30. I'm also in Act III of the campaign, which I'm playing through on Hardcore.The Campaign is by far one of the most story-rich and lore-packed we've seen from the franchise so far, and it's clear they're trying to emphasize it a bit more, which is a welcome addition, especially since - so far, it doesn't seem to have detracted from the flow and pacing of the game too much. The writing is pretty good, it has to be said. My only real gripe with the campaign, has to do with the open-world sections in acts II and III, although they add a little bit more content and more things to do; the spaces do feel a tiny bit barren. And it shows it's these guys' first try at implementing this into one of their games.I feel like the game's challenging on Hardcore, to a reasonable level - generally you won't die much, outside of the Boss-fights and some of the larger set-piece engagements, and you never tend to feel stuck, as you'll generally be able to work out what to do after a couple attempts. But I'm looking forwards to trying it on Insane with some pals, just to see how much the difficulty ramps up. Versus, is the same old gore-fest we all know and love, packed full of intense shotgun battles and dramatic stand-offs. Again, can't really fault it, apart from the odd issue with the servers, though I have to admit - in the four or so hours I've sunk into multiplayer, I've only encountered this issue once, but I know that others have seen it happen a lot more.Escape - I don't even really know where to start with, I've only really played three matches of it, and only completed like one act so far, it's definitely a lot of fun and even on the lowest challenge level, it can be pretty tricky if you're not coordinated. Especially with the low levels of ammunition in the start of each round. But yeah, it's an enjoyable addition to an already solid game.Horde, I've not played a lot of high-difficulty rounds of, but it's pretty solid, basically the same deal as past titles, but with a bit more flexibility on where you can place items, and with a few odd little things here and there like energy extractors to make it feel like it's own beast.Tl;dr, Gears 5 is an amazing addition to the franchise, bringing you back to the glory days of the first three games, easily one of, if not the best AAA titles I've played this year. And I'd give it a solid 9/10. They just need to work on a few little issues with connectivity and audio for headset users, and it'll definitely be a game I remember fondly years from now.",1 person found this review helpful,Recommended

I understand there are some ping and connection issues, but hopefully once they get fixed it'll get a little more positive on steam. I've really enjoyed mp so far, I think Escape is pretty cool too, the new arcade quickplay is a neat addition. Haven't gotten around to horde or Campaign just yet though. I don't like the lack of characters, especially the ocg's barely having any real old faces besides marcus but I know they're working on that (hopefully). So far the maps are nice but either there aren't many maps, or I just keep seeing the same few, more maps would be great. The Tour of Duty system is ok. It's not as bad as people say but some improvements should be made to make it better. The grind isn't as bad either, though I know there are some rough challenges. More unlockables like gears 3 would be really nice instead of the current store and Tour of Duty though. Overall, so far, I'd totally say get this game. It's real satisfying to pull off those clutch and fun moment.

117,Posted: September 10,12.3 hrs on record,"I'm a long-time Gears fan, having played the original on an old Xbox 360, and have enjoyed the games every since (apart from that weird prequel one, which seemed a little indulgent)This is a worthy and thoughtful addition to the franchise. Gears has grown from a blood-and-guts shooter into something huge and multi-faceted. There are a number of reasons why.The campaign is fascinating and the characters complex enough to keep you interested. I never thought that issues about fertility, neo-fascism and moral instability would make it into a game that has assault rifles with chainsaws on them. It's a welcome surprise, carefully laid out and well executed.The weapons roster has become huge as well. Just about every dynamic thought possible, as well as some you'd think were impossible, in a third-person shooter, are executed perfectly. Sniper rifles, rocket launchers, sub-machine guns, tactical turrets, handguns, grenades... there's a huge variety of weapons to wield and foes to blast with them. However, through it all, the Gnasher shotgun still has a cult following all of it's own.The multiplayer remains a glorious mess of people scrambling for weapons and performing thrilling heroics, and Horde is more awesome than ever.Perhaps some of the criticism here is warranted about grinding / multiplayer skins. But this stuff is entirely cosmetic and there for people to sink lots of hours into, or bypass with cash. I'm sure that The Coalition will alter this in due course, so there's no need for people to get so annoyed. But then it's 2019, and people take their frustrations out on these things.I do recommend this game. It's refreshing, thoughtful and well presented. If the price tag is a little high for you, which I understand, wait for a sale and purchase it.",2 people found this review helpful,Recommended

122,Posted: September 11,5.6 hrs on record,"Gears 5 is great, the gameplay is there and there's a lot of things to do. If you want more Gears then this game delivers.However, versus progression is non-existent, not to mention Execution is not even a ranked playlist and that is what I usually play most in a Gears game. There's only 7 characters to choose from either side, all which are unlocked from the get go. For some insane reason, characters that appear in the campaign aren't playable??? No Baird, Cole, Carmine and many more. There's almost an equal amount of guest characters than there are Gears characters, a decision that really sucks the life out of the game. Levelling up gains you nothing but progression towards earning useless emotes and sprays. The ONLY things you get from the INSANELY grindy battlepass are skins from the campaign for characters you already own, some weapon skins and mostly emotes, sprays and banners which are pointless.I am shocked that there is basically nothing to unlock that is worthwhile, nothing to aim for. Anything even remotely interesting is locked behind a ridiculously overpriced shop or the later levels of the pass which are seemingly impossible to reach.It really seems they stripped the VS side of content in favour of character specific abilities for Horde and microtransactions. Marcus is LITERALLY the ONLY original trilogy character you can play as. Hope for more niche characters like Onyx Guard and Valera is completely gone seeing as you can't even play as 90% of Delta Squad. Overall the way they've handled progression, unlocks and characters in general is atrocious and really makes playing anything other than the campaign kind of meaningless. I only hope that they listen to the community and work on adding everyone back in to the game and sort out their disgusting attempt at a battlepass and microtransaction store. Oh and please for the love of god, make Execution a ranked playlist over TDM!!!There is no excuse for this, Gears of War 4 managed this perfectly fine with both skins and the character pool.",1 person found this review helpful,Not Recommended

130,Posted: September 11,5.5 hrs on record,"Gears 5 is the best looking Unreal game to date. It has great optimization, no issues, nothing. I saw countless discussions about issues, bugs, etc. None of them exist for me. Game works great and is great. It is a full fledged Gears experience. If you liked the first 4 games, you're gonna like this too. But if you are a newcomer, that's fine too. Gears is for everyone.Boomers are mad because they can't stand the idea of a female protagonist. Kait is a great character. Versus is also great. Yeah, there are microtransactions and nobody wants them. But that's not the developer's fault, you can be sure of that. So don't throw ♥♥♥♥ at the game because of some corporate decision.It needs connection improvements. Other than that, it's your good old Gears multiplayer experience.It's a good product, don't miss it.",3 people found this review helpful,Recommended

I do however hate the campaign for more then a couple reasons.Good:GameplayModesGraphicsBad:Cutscenes would freeze but characters continued to talk making me miss some cutscenes, even the ending ( I have a 2080ti)The campaign is bad and the story is the worst of the series maybe that's because I really don't like Kait but regardless  nothing too interesting happens. There is no real heart wrenching moments like there was in the other Gears games. The Campaign just ends out of nowhere and the decision you have to make in the game is pretty stupid because now we wont know what actually happened in Gears 5 until Gears 6. I see people saying that this Gears had the best campaign out of all the Gears games and I dont understand how they see that.

156,Posted: September 11,17.8 hrs on record,"*I will edit my review later after I play multiplayer, as I just completed the campaign in about 20 hours on the easiest difficulty. I will edit when I play some multiplayer. So as of 9/11, this is about the campaign alone. (And my library states I have 25 hours, while the store page states I have 17.3 hours.)TL;DR for those that don't wanna read. Wonderful campaign. Wonderful graphics. Wonderful emotion and heartfelt moments. I literally cried a few times throughout the campaign because of those heartfelt moments. Thankyou Coalition.For the actual review, I'm gonna -try- to say as little spoilers as possible.The campaign is absolutely amazing, I played through it but didn't rush. I mostly looked around trying to find collectables, found about 60% of my first run I believe. The characters all feel like they have their own personalities, character development is good for what the game has to offer since the campaign is all on the perspective of a soldier (as is the whole series). And there currently not very many bugs, throughout the whole campaign, I ran into maybe one or two bugs and I kinda giggled at them.. Though have heard others ran into gamebreaking ones, but nothing's perfect.I have seen that a player can play as Jack, which is pretty interesting. I hope to find somebody to play the campaign a few times for other difficulties and styles (like noone is Jack, one player play as Jack, or have 2 others and maybe take turns playing as a certain character or something).The Coalition seem to care for Gears 5 more than they did Gears 4, but I'm okay with that. They did a wonderful job, and I hope for the best for the future for them and the future of Gears.P.S. Whoever wrote the script for some of those heartfelt scenes, you did a wonderful job.

161,Posted: September 9,31.9 hrs on record,"I'll start with the negatives- Microtransactions - Grindy progression system- Graphical bugs (only during cutscenes) - Wonky Friendly AI- Buggy sections during Campaign - Enemies (very rarely) get stuck under the map, but can screw up an entire Horde match - Characters like Baird, Carmine and COLE TRAIN aren't playable (yet)BUT+Lengthy campaign +Decent and fun level design+Well written characters  +Beautiful graphics +Great sound quality +Lots of Co-Op content (Campaign, Horde, Escape) +NO (paid) LOOTBOXES+LOTS OF FUN TO PLAY! (The controls are really smooth and snappy. Securing kills are very satisfying and movement is fairly quick)For it's current price, I'd say it's worth it if you're looking for a good Co Op game for you and your friends. Online Versus is also quite fun and intense, but you need to get used to certain tactics. Playing Horde or Escape with strangers who don't communicate can get boring and frustrating, so I recommend bringing some friends. Of course, be prepared for a very grindy progression system in the form of a FREE battle pass. So far, there are no P2W microtransactions as they only seem to focus on cosmetics and XP boosts, but time will tell. Also, it's a bit of a pain to level up your character for Horde and Escape as it requires RNG to receive certain cards for each character. You need duplicates (AND the currency 'Scrap' which you get from getting duped items from 'supply drops' AKA lootboxes) in order to level up a card. Good thing is, you CANNOT pay for supply drops with real money, you receive these as daily log ins or by completing matches. As for the Ultimate Edition,if you are a diehard Halo fan (like myself), I would recommend considering it as Noble Team's Emile and Kat both look excellent in game. The attention to detail of their armor looks superb and I was thrilled to finally see them in such great quality. PLUS, the original voice actors return! However, know the Ultimate Edition only contains these 2 characters, some skins/banners and a XP boost, so it's very understandable if you don't want to fork over the extra cash.",2 people found this review helpful,Recommended

174,Posted: September 9,28.3 hrs on record,"Wow, first review, I'm surprised :D 10 September 2:18amFrom one of gamingâ€™s most acclaimed sagas, Gears is bigger than ever, with five thrilling modes and the deepest campaign yet.Complete BS, complete waste of money if you want gears 5 for the campaign, the open world ruined the campaign, the game is incredibly short and the ""open world"" has practically nothing in it and a waste of time, the time spent making that redundant ""open world"" would have been better spent on developing the story instead of rehashing gears of war 2 and Escape mode is boring as hell as of the moment so I can only hope they make it more interesting with future operations.Gears of War - five acts with 31 chapters (on pc it has a few extra chapters even)Gears of War 2 - five acts with 29 chapters and an additional chapter from a dlcGears of War 3 - five acts with 30 chapters and a brief prologue mission and the dlc missions you play during the outbreak of E-DayGears of War:Judgment - seven acts with 48 chapters and the dlc chapter based in GoW3Gears of War 4 - five acts with 22 chaptersGears of War 5 - four acts with 15 chaptersAct 1 has four chapters, however, in chapter two it is literally just a cut scene and a 30 second introduction on upgrading jacks abilities so in truth there is only 3 chapters to act 1Act 2 there are five chapters, however, chapter 2/3/4 is open world and amounts to only 2 chapters at best, chapter 5 is a proper chapter.Act 3 there are four chapters but again is mostly open world and again is two, maybe two and a half chapters at bestAct 4 is two chapters and they are proper chaptersSo over all there are only 9 true chapters to this game.To make it worse, AI partners are morons and completely useless and pointless just like the open world part of the game, they can't do anything, once you go up against the torque bow, they will get hit with it and run straight into you, getting you killed from the explosion, the controls are also unresponsive a lot of the time were you can't even shoot or you get locked in position but can move your camera so you can see death slap you in the face and laugh at you for buying this pathetic excuse of a Gears of War game.The only reason it took me a while to complete the game was because I spent most of the time looking for collectibles and relic weapons.If you are a Gears of War fan that likes their game to have subsistence and not rehash GoW 1/2 locations and GoW 2 plot then don't buy this garbage, complete waste of money. However, if you are in it for the PvP, Horde, Escape multiplayer, then its not bad, but Escape mode is very bland and boring, but maybe that can at the very lest be improved on in future operations they release.",31 people found this review helpful8 people found this review funny,Not Recommended

Legit hits don't register. The lancer is now the game maker. People will spray you like a roach. and if you thought you could just pull up with the gnasher you thought wrong. The shotgun feels like the fortnite shotgun where you shoot and do like 4% and the enemy who was at the same exact distance as you does 100% and you just assume your aim was off when it wasn't.

The only reason these problems hurt more than they should is because the game may crash 2 times in one hour, but i bet that marketplace wont.  BRAH YOU CANT EVEN EARN THE CREDITS TO BUY FROM THE SHOP AT ALL. They took out all of the skins and characters from 4 and its so damn barren on content to unlock. The way you unlock stuff is by doing anything in game to earn supply crates which will give you duplicates of other trash ♥♥♥ banners that you don't even want. The Horde mode is dry af. I liked gears 4 better.

You can only play split screen during the campaign, so it's almost like they pulled a Halo 5 with the removal of, arguably, the best feature of the game, playing a local horde mode match with your buddy on the same screen. Whilst split screen is available on the Xbox one, I can't help but feel confused as to why they couldn't implicate it for the PC which mind you, can run the game 10x better if you have the parts. If you're looking for a good story, this game definitely has it. A mix between an open world and a linear story is beautifully blended in this game, albeit sometimes feeling like a chore to go from one point to another and then another. The gameplay however, makes up for this with it's core Gears elements. Run and gun, and now with the addition of a somewhat small skill tree that Jack has, makes the PvE'ing 10x better. Don't be fooled by my hours played on the game, I just went offline to make sure the game doesn't track my hours so I could get a refund at the end. TL; DR:Game is fun, story is cool, ♥♥♥♥ you guys for removing splitscreen on PC.",3 people found this review helpful1 person found this review funny,Not Recommended

196,Posted: September 10,31.8 hrs on record,Happy to see Gears of War on Steam. Please put the Original Trilogy XDI have run into literally no performance issues or glitches. Everything runs smooth with maybe a few sound issues here and there.Still the best third-person shooter and the best of its genre. The second best thing on the Unreal Engine since UT2004 / UT3Overall the story is solid and picks up a little after 4 with a recap vid in-case you forgot the deep intertwining plotline or have never played 4 before. Gameplay is one of the best in the series since the original. Guns handle really well and actually feel powerful with the sound and effects. It is really satisfying to completely destroy the enemy whether meat or machine and turn them into a pile of blood and gore. The equivalent to me would be John Wick for the intensity of gun battles and non-stop action but still with a deep lore and having you wanting for more or Mad Max Fury Road. The brutality makes this basically Mortal Kombat done as a shooter. The main reason I bought this was for all the cameos and guest appearance skins. I def got my moneys worth after seeing all the little details that went into the game and all the in-depth game modes and being blown away yet again like 4 and the other games. Horde is just as good as it has ever been especially with 4 other players trying to get to the end of the 50 Waves. As far as I can tell there is no Solo but not having to pay for Gold seems to balance that out XDEscape (The new mode) feels like it was ripped straight from Warframe and I mean that in a good way. It's a short game mode where you try to get to the end of the randomly generated corridor / maze with increasingly difficult enemies as you get closer to the exit. You also only have limited supplies kind of like a survival horror. Overall Gears of War 5 is easily one of the best games of 2019. I don't really see anything wrong. They basically improved on 4 in almost every way while adding many new features and weapons. Highly recommend getting this even at full price you won't be disappointed. Don't listen to the haters.,8 people found this review helpful,Recommended

216,Posted: September 10,24.1 hrs on record,"(Have owned and been playing since September 6th. 2019.)Hadn't played the Gears of War series since #3 on the good old Xbox 360 back in the day, seeing as I loved the series at the time and that Gears 5 was being released on steam I knew it couldn't be bad. Pros:1. The core gameplay is the same as I'm used to and it's even improved. I absolutely love the gun-play alongside the movement and mechanics revolved around power weapons in versus creating leads for a team when used and they don't seem overly strong which is nice. I had never played Gears on PC previously and find it very comfortable.2. The newly designed Horde mode makes it feel quite satisfying to choose specific characters knowing that they each serve a purpose. E.g character 'Del' specialises in repairs with a special ability that deploys homing bots which explode and kill Swarm. There's a bunch of unique characters which just make Horde mode feel less 'Eh' than previous Gears titles.3. The campaign was just... holy ♥♥♥♥. I'd play the game just for the campaign if that's all it was on the market for. They really have outdone themselves with this newer campaign. Being able to customise your play-style using J.A.C.K's abilities feels amazing. It really is just cool. You can have a mass team cloak for example as an active ability or J.A.C.K can even 'Hijack' certain enemy types and turn them on their own which is just badass. The campaign is all in all just not what it used to be with its linear level design and pathing through the playthrough. Not to spoil too much but Gears 5 actually has free roam aspects within its campaign which is completely unheard of within the previous titles and I love it. Did I mention you can play as J.A.C.K? Yeah. Insane. The CO-OP makes for an incredible experience as well including all of the above basically doubled with possibilities. Cons:1. Okay so can we not lean towards the Fortnite cosmetic/personal progression system? That'd be great thanks! Love you TC!2. Not entirely sure if it has been purely my internet but I believe there's still player based hosting within online matches. I find this very frustrating when joining a match with an unexpected 600ms.TLDR; A very great game within the GoW series to pick up if you're unfamiliar with the franchise and also still nostalgic and enjoyable for returning Gears veterans. Just beware of the current strange/out of nowhere free cosmetic grind system which I personally believe does not belong in Gears which has been put in place as a reward for just playing and doing certain objectives (Similar to Fortnite Battle Pass). The rewards (at least right now) are lackluster and are not very satisfying or appealing to collect unless you're a completionist player.",5 people found this review helpful,Recommended

258,Posted: September 10,24.1 hrs on record,"Gotta agree with some of the contexts where Gears doesn't look really gritty and muted as it was before. There's too many sappy colors on this and Gears of War 4. Hoping they at least let us have the graphics option to go muted/gritty colors.Next up is catering to SJW. I don't know why The Coalition's doing this for a game that was born to answer to manly men and strong gritty women. It doesn't bother me much, but this kind of action speaks volumes on the direction The Coalition is taking this game to.The blood and gore details... Most of it are lost. While you still get to keep the delicious bits and blobs, it's a shame you don't see the map get littered with blood as the battle rages on. Now it just remains squeaky clean.Rest of the features some complain about are understandable or just fine. Unlockable skins that come from the campaign are alright as it's the first Tour of Duty. Tour of Duty being a greedy chap that won't give you rewards that properly compensate you for the amount of grind you did can be a learning process for The Coalition (Apex Legend's first Battle Pass was pretty ♥♥♥♥ too).Server lags and stability are being worked on, you can check out The Coalition's Twitter as they keep us updated with the fixes. Day 1 for Ultimate Edition had a lot of crashes, now there's barely any crash and I haven't got booted off a game the past day. Graphics Cards problem is something I don't have so I won't be delving on that, though I do use a 980ti.Overall, I can genuinely recommend the game. The story is great and the modes will keep you playing for a long while. Few characters in Multiplayer, but I'm going to assume The Coalition did this so that they can go hand in hand with skins for versus and abilities for coop modes.My other option was getting Borderlands 3 or NFS Heat, but the FIFA bloke running NFS Heat ain't looking pretty and while Borderlands 3 is great, it doesn't exactly have a serviceable multiplayer for when I want to butt heads with other players.",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

Unlimited fps in game and during cutscenes make the game crisp with the ultra HD pack. I'm running a 1080 with 8700k on ultra and I'm getting around 180+ fps. Story is a little to be desired.

Updated, no longer have any audio whatsoever, but the update allows the game to run better.To combat this, I had to manually force windows 10 to use a basic windows HD audio driver, which gives me worse audio options for things outside of gaming (such as tv shows and movies).This is really the reason why many people prefer console, you don't have to bother with this nonsense.TLDR - Great looking game, suffering tremendously in the audio department, and cannot recommend until these audio problems are corrected.",9 people found this review helpful,Not Recommended

Great story, which is a trademark of Gears of War series with the exception of mediocre story of 4th game. Large maps with side missions is a nice addition to the series and the way they are handled is pretty good. Standard GoW multiplayer modes.Only bad thing is the multiplayer store and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ pricing system of basic cosmetic items.

301,Posted: September 10,15.9 hrs on record,"From What I have gathered, The game is solid HOWEVER did they butcher campaign so BADLY. The marketing for it was horrid for campaign, I guess i got the wrong memo when they shown multiple characters.....But if you want to play it I wont stop you at all. There is maybe 1 redeeming quality to it, that certain part to the story made the game just a tiny bit better. Campaign is pretty bad, probably the shortest amongst all gears game, which is depressing. They tried to set it up as a cliffhanger game like Gears 1 and I think Halo 2? Except Gears 1 had more Chapters and Halo 2 had handeled it a bit better with main character switch. Overall I would recommend this if you love the series and is interested in where the story might go.Multiplayer, oh boy. Multiplayer feels like gears 4 but polished to the right extent. TC put more time into multiplayer consideration compared to Campaign from how i played it. The gnasher and guns overall are all strong which might ♥♥♥♥ some people off but its early into the games life so expect tuning in the later future. Grinding for skins, yeah that sucks honestly, I thought it would be more like Gears Of War 3 character grind, Sadly it is not. In Conclusion The game is Centered towards Multiplayer and partly due to the ESports scene. I however can't lie the multiplayer is if not the best it has ever been if you want to throw away your nostalgia glasses from gears 1-3. The game overall gets a 6.5/10 for me. I love the multiplayer and even with some glitches its fine but that campaign........needs a serious rework if gears 6 will be like that.P.S. Gears 5 did better in multiplayer aspect compared to Judgement but lacked the longevity of a Campaign compared to Judgement. Also as to why I recomend this game, Multiplayer is good, like its ever been honestly. The saving grace to this game is It's multiplayer.",1 person found this review helpful1 person found this review funny,Recommended
302,Posted: September 10,14.4 hrs on record,What I love:- Weapons feel good and ripping through enemies with bloodplosions never felt better.- Beautiful environments ranging from over-grown labs to vast deserts- Exploration is rewarded towards (some-aspect of) character progression- Boss fights are intenseWhat i didn't like/problems i encountered:- Frame rate drops and freezing during gameplay & start/end of cutscenes- Sometimes noticably blurry textures(I have the ultra texture dlc installed)- Certain gunfights lack enemy numbers and are over really quickly.- Audio being out of sync due to the freezing- Free-roam aspect gets abit tiring after a whileThis could be a perfect Gears game but sadly it has been ruined by technical issues that will spoil your enjoyment of the game.,2 people found this review helpful,Not Recommended

I payed extra to play early and the servers were barely working the entire time and now even after full release the game is constantly disconnecting me for no reason. To add on top of this there are no characters to even play as in multiplayer. All the classic characters besides Marcus aren't there. I hope these will be added in some time in the near future but with the way this game is looking i doubt it will be without a 20 dollar price tag in their wanna be Fortnite store.

340,Posted: September 10,1.3 hrs on record,"I am a fan of the Gears of War series (although I'm just a PC player, I watched the campaign of previous Gears of War parts and sometimes multiplayer), therefore thinking that multiplayer in Gears of War 4 was very good and that in 5 parts will be Terminator and Sarrah Connor, if I pre-order it, I ordered it with great joy and probably my joy will not last long...The PC game on my 5-year equipment in 1080p resolution and Ultra graphics works smoothly as in Gears of War 4 (100+ FPS), this 5 part looks nice and that's probably the plus.Minus is not a measure... B2P game and if you want to unlock a skin, you get the currency to buy them or by completing tasks in Tour Duty (I am not sure if I get the next rank or are assigned to a specific rank, I only know that some rank on the irons bank) or you have to buy them for real cash for not a small amount seriously T.C. and M$? and the currency called scrap you will receive by destroying some cards or skins there as they will be repeated, just great! it's such a hardcore grind that EA in its NFS: Payback and Loot Boxes in Star Wars: Battlefront II is embarrassing !.In the previous part it was better solved ... for every match you played you got the currency to buy loot boxes (I'm not a fan of loot boxes but the previous part has better grind than this one) and for higher levels (characters, account assignments?) You also got currency and here ... you will only get the currency to unlock the skins after you do the tasks from Tour Duty seriously? what the hell are these character levels ?! and EXP boosters for them.The second is a technical matter ... I don't know, it's difficult to rent European M$ and T.C. servers? you did the Tech test, there was Early Acces and I see in the premiere that not only I have ping every time 150+ !!! and frequent disconnections! what is that supposed to be ?! do you want to share the fate of Neowiz with their title of Bless Online ?.It's really hard to play with such a ping ... in the first match I had such killing delays that I died more often than I won ... it was only in the second match that I had such a high ping that I found a team of opponents which was not overwhelming and then it was possible to play somehow ... so what should I play only with unlimited players, because that's how I will get through delays ?!I am really not happy with this product, it is a total technical failure and so rude microtransactions to give where and the currency to buy skins or unlock them is how you only do something from Tour Duty or buy it for a large sum.I do not know, I will think about tomorrow whether to ask Steam for a refund ... because this is the peak of impudence to give servers suck and after buying the game still ask for microtransactions...The game itself is not bad... if only for microtransactions and bad pings...BTW: Sorry for my English",10 people found this review helpful1 person found this review funny,Not Recommended

347,Posted: September 11,10.7 hrs on record,"Pretty fun game so far, but it's ruined by bugs. The AI is crap, they never help you in any mode including campaign but I suppose the gears AI has always sucked. I figured with the emphasis on bot filling for horde they would've made some improvement but I was wrong.The game itself is actually good, campaign so far is actually pretty great, escape is a pretty meh mode. It's the same map over and over again so it'll lose it's shiny ""ohh I wanna play that"" feeling extremely fast. The multiplayer is decent but buggy at times with finding matches. Campaign has some pretty solid cinematics but it'll do things like randomly freeze and make u have to force the game to close, so far this is a rare but very frustrating issue.On horde ive seen the ai just jog randomly into a wall 2 feet away from me while I am down and just continue to jog until an enemy finally gets to me to execute me. In campaign I've had moments like that also(a lot, and it is infuriating), not with them running into the wall but they'll just be right next to me if I get downed yell ""Im coming to help"" from 2-3 feet away then just sit there and watch you die and do nothing. Honestly it's just the bugs that annoy me, they are various and frustrating and while many won't show up all the time, many will show up way too often for my sub 9 hours of game time, even my first hour of game time was troubleshooting broken lobbies.If they actually patch it and smooth it out which I assume they will seeing as it's a new release then I'll change my review to positive. The game itself in terms of gameplay overall is a very positive experience. The bugs are just getting really annoying. Too many game breakers or if not breaking the game ruining it in one way or another.I've owned every Gears game that has ever come out, besides Judgement I put a lot of time into all of them and for anyone who knows judgement you understand instantly why that was the one I didn't. This game actually so far seems like it could be the best in the series. I like the gunplay more in this game, I enjoy the combat a lot more, I enjoy the systems implemented to add to the campaign experience and I like the variety I see in the world that wasn't near as nice in GoW4. If the bugs get fixed or at least smoothen out and reduce my issues I'll be a lot happier and I'll at that point write a proper review and from my experience so far(if I ignore bugs) I expect it'll be positive and thumbs up as bugs are the only reason I am not recommending this right now. This could change pretty quick considering many of my issues are probably general issues a lot of experiencing and should be worked on pretty quickly.Another big thing to keep in mind. They talked about this game pre-release like they were gonna get rid of the bs microtransactions and predatory monetization with talk like ""No season pass"" and ""no more loot boxes"".The truth is while that is technically true, they just lied to us all and they are scumbags for it. What they did was take the timer off the mobile marketing strategy of grinding and wasting your time. The grinding is way over the top, and I mean WAY over the top. They use that to make sure you aren't getting anything but the game is good enough to make u want to get things for it...so what's their magical solution to the issue they created on purpose? MICROTRANSACTIONS! Honestly even if they fix the bugginess I might have to keep it red anyways because I spent 60 bucks on this game and I really don't like being lied to. This game could be a 10/10 and I might still keep it red due to that. We're used to scumbag devs, but these devs straight up spit in all of our faces as we handed them our money after seeing ""no loot boxes"" and ""no season pass"" and getting hopeful for once in these modern gaming times.As far as the grind itself I'll end with this, sometimes you can play the game for hours and have nothing to show for it in terms of in game rewards. Keep in mind this is only about 9 hours of actual gameplay at this point so it has to make you wonder if the grind will get even worse as you level up and actually get a couple of decent items or skins. It's disappointing to say the least because generally speaking we aren't bothered by cosmetic only microtransactions if it helps support development of the game, and sure makes them even a little more profit. It's throttling the way the progression works and slowing it to a crawl on purpose to promote more microtransactions that really pisses us off.",3 people found this review helpful,Not Recommended

350,Posted: September 9,4.3 hrs on record,"The campaign is only around 10-15 hours long and it really should be 25-35 hours. The sprint animation can also give people motion sickness - so be aware, I actually have to stop sprinting because it was that bad (I play FPS like cod/BF/Overwatch no problem, this game gives me literal headaches). The multiplayer also get old pretty fast, with limited number of maps and the combat just not being fun enough to play over and over again. The other modes are OK but again, they get repetitive fast.This is a $35-40 game, not a $60, wait for a sale.EDIT: my biggest beef with this game is that, for $60, how repetitive it gets, with its campaign being so short and lack of interesting side missions and basically a hallway shooter, the multiplayer NEEDS to pick up the slack. It doesn't, while there are 3 modes (escape, versus and horde), they are honestly quite bland and uninteresting after the first few games.",12 people found this review helpful1 person found this review funny,Not Recommended

 This will be a review talking about the single player campaign. I will be breaking it down with zero spoilers. Whether you're new to the franchise, played a few games in the past or are into the expanded universe with almost every game under your belt I encourage you to read other reviews going into the multiplayer. But the single player is the main meat of the game that I will be getting into.Make sure to smash that like button like my Dad smashed the sanctity of my parent's marriage if you liked this review.If you want a video version I made one here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ-ryoxWil4 The long story short is that the Gears 5 single player campaign is almost terrible. For every good thing in this game there's at least one bad one. If you're looking to buy the game for single player first and multiplayer second, I straight-up would wait for a sale if I were you. While not as bad as Gears of War 4 it's still mediocre and retains the frustratingly bait & switch opening. The game starts off promising enough with an amazing Act 1. In fact, I'd say this game's first act is the most fun I've had in any Gears game. Unlike the previous entry where the first level was great because it was a nostalgia trip, here we have good variety in level design and looks, fun new weapons, great writing which means better characterization. I actually was laughing at the humor and I felt for some of the struggles of the characters.Then Act 2 happened. The first part was alright but then you realize that all that fun you've been having is tiny in the grand scheme of things because Gears 5 decided it HAD to be open world. That's right. A game franchise built around a strong, linear structure is now open world and it's not even good. Driving around is fun but everything you do starts to have a lot of ""back and forth"" to it. There's no fast travel or things to do in between driving (it's not like you're shooting enemies unique to the open area). No, you're just driving from one point to another and constantly back tracking with barely anything besides dialogue in between trips. It sucks. There's side missions, collectibles and objectives that can give you more context to what you're doing which is alright but I cannot help but get annoyed with the damn characters that I'm supposed to like. Despite being the first things you see in the trailer material on Steam, that stuff is what happens the least in the game. It's all ice & desert world.The characters in this game are awful. In Gear of War 4 characterization was pretty poor. In the opening of Gears 5 they are a lot more fleshed out and actually have some fun back & forth. But as soon as Act 2 starts you get the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dialogue from 4 where they constantly spout stupid questions with lazy attempts at humor near the end. It's like the writers are jerking themselves off: ""HA, LOOK AT OUR CHARACTERS, AREN'T THEY SO QUIRKY AND FUNNY!?!"". No, they're not funny and they're not interesting.The core gameplay is serviceable and the story is actually kinda interesting. I'd say it's just enough to keep you playing but the problem is that the previous entries did it better through pacing and gunplay. While new things like RPG elements are introduced to allow for character powers in an odd attempt to be kinda like Mass Effect it comes nowhere close to being as fun. It just feels tacked on to make the game even easier. Furthermore regarding previous entries: Gears 2 kept shifting environments and had gunplay that really felt great with how you ripped through enemies with either bullets or chainsaw lancers. They've toned down the blood effects here and you are essentially playing in 2 environments most of the game (ice and desert). The story is at least cool if you're into the lore but if you never played gears 2 and especially 4 you're not going to be as invested as what is going in or even know what any of this stuff is. Despite being a ""longer game"" there's arguably less shooting. The Ice level is at least cool because there are hazards (not in the vehicle, on foot) that you have to avoid and you can use against the enemies (like shooting through thin ice to drown them).But not the same sentiment in the desert level other than its a way to show of the graphics. I came here for something fun and all I got was something pretty to look at.In conclusion:Gears 5 gameplay is a decade ahead of Gears 2 in release and graphics but feels like its half a decade behind it in gameplay, pacing and overall writing. The game starts great but just falls through the floor immediately after the first act and that is the most frustrating part: It could have been good.The recommendation is primarily for the single player right now and just what I think. Thank you for reading. It's worth getting on sale or playing with a friend in co-op past the first act. If you just want multiplayer it's decent but it needs more work.",45 people found this review helpful3 people found this review funny,Not Recommended

385,Posted: September 9,36.0 hrs on record,"This is the worst time to be a Gears of War fan.The franchise has been completely murdered by The Coalition. A company that only cares about profiting from this fatherless franchise with a community that is unable to defend itself. They have absolutely no passion for this franchise. Lazy laggy development ruined even further by a psychological plan of making all free cosmetics bad and locked behind a massive grind wall so that the average innocent person would feel forced to buy a good expensive cosmetic from the store to enjoy the game.The Campaign is the only decent part of this entire game. A huge improvement from the boring mess that was Gears 4. However it is buggy. The AI is completely stupid and suicidal and the audio issues are annoying. The story went from being about JD fenix the son of the living war hero Marcus Fenix and his best pal Del to being about a character written by a group of SJWs called Kait. A character that is 90% corny and cheesy.The Versus multiplayer is a complete ♥♥♥♥ show!There was a Tech Test/beta about 1 month ago. They completely ignored every single feedback and report made by the players.The extreme bugs still exist. The entire month was spent advertising and marketing the Campaign and horde mode paying youtubers and content creators and sponsoring 3rd parties.-The rifle damage and stopping power is insanely overpowered. (Heavily aim assisted with a controller) -The shotgun damage is very strong lowering the skill gap that was barely living before. any fool with a trigger can kill you. -The smoke grenade is left completely useless outmatched by the incredibly overpowered and over spammed flash grenade.-The servers are a total mess. High pings on every player besides 1 in each lobby, putting EU players in NA and NA in EU. -The Tour of duty(free battlepass system) is an insane grind asking you to do exaggerated challenges for worthless items for a very small variety of skins. -Catering to Casuals, they have designed the new versus changes in favor of the casuals and bad players heavily killing a large part of the skill gap any fool with a team or with a shotgun can shoot any where and kill you. also in certain situations 5 man squads will completely use these casual metas to stomp and farm casuals. good players are forced to lower their brains and skills to be able to cope with the new horrible casual metas. -The Senior Community Manager ""TC Octus"" is purposely out of touch with the core community if you look at his twitter hes only replying to irrelevant questions and positive tweets completely avoiding answering important questions because he knows he has no answer. His answers are usually ""we're looking into it"". They have changed so many things including reticles, damage indicators, health omens, weapons, movement etc etc just for the sake of making the game stick out and make you think it looks new and refreshing when in reality they brought nothing new.Every weapon made so much stronger making it very hard for you to get more than 1-2 kills before dying. The Horde mode and Escape mode:zzzThese developers have never cared for this franchise their only goal is to profit. the only thing that can hurt them is if sales drop but even then theyll still milk sheep from their microtransactions. Please do yourselves a favor and do not buy this game, it is not worth more than $2 at most. Do not let these shady and malevolent business men win over you.This game is Gears of War judgement in disguise. (This last part is being misunderstood as me being homophobic, the point of this part is to show that they've disrespected the Saudi Arabian flag which also disrespects a belief of more than 1.8 billion people but they try to show themselves as caring by putting LGBT banners.

391,Posted: September 9,27.4 hrs on record,"To sum it up, I'd Rate this game a  M E H Reminds me of  Arkham Knight launch ...Gears 5 launch is a flub of similar level.As of now, Constant Disconnects (Had to use Teredo guide for xbox to fix connection issues and Matchmaking issues to an extent That guide still didn't solve the problems as there are still major disconnects during matchmaking and in general (8 out of 10 matches in any mode will end up in a disconnection or in some error) Connection Sync issues in some cases, XBOX live login issues in some Career Progression wont get tracked Some crashes, which would result in system lockups Rewards wont unlock Bugged achievement in some cases Bugged dialogue audioWhile there are some absolute fun things in the game Co-op (when it works) Horde and escape mode (when it works and when people dont quit at wave 40+) PvP (again, when it works) Campaign has been good so far, but its the multiplayer thats addictive. Fluid Gameplay Awesome gunplay The graphics, oh yesAt its current state, its best to get it on Gamepass for $2 or if you are in a region like mine where it costs about $28 Considering this was the first major Gears to release on Steam and considering this game had Playtests/Betas, the game at its current state is frustrating, fun and mind boggling  Did the devs not learn from Gears 4? If they fix all the issues, I will definitely change my review and rating.",23 people found this review helpful2 people found this review funny,Not Recommended
392,Posted: September 9,21.3 hrs on record,"For the love of god. Please, make a Ranked mode without Gnashers! Also, an option to not play against console users with their near aimbot level of aim assist. Love the story mode, to bad its the shortest in the series. I would in its current state, only give this game a 3/5. Horde is boring, Escape is pointless, Versus is just god awful. Get it for the story then put it down til an update comes out. Seems like the gaming trend nowadays.Man i want to love this game, but i can't. I thought cross-play would be good, but now i fear the worst for upcoming titles such as MW. If aim assist is so strong that i get 1 shot while behind cover, ♥♥♥♥ that. There are really good controller users and there are really bad M&K users, this way of balancing is extremely punishing to anyone not using a controller or simply can't. Solution: ask upfront if either platform would prefer cross-play, then give controllers slight stickness for mid level body and slight less for head level and call it a day. DO NOT go the route Gears 5 did and give bullet magnetism to shots that are up to two feet away either horizontal or vertical and count it as a headshot.Lastly, I still cannot connect to servers with a certain ISP and the support team did nothing to help after contacting them. That and they completely ignored my second question about cross-save.This was an upvote but after putting in the hours and being frustrated with everything but the Story. I am also so happy that leveling up does nothing, rare chance of decent skins, nothing to show off in game.",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Not Recommended

434,Posted: September 10,18.2 hrs on record,"I've only played Gears of War 1 and will compare this game to it.1 - Gameplay is almost the same but playing got less comfortable and the new enemies are useless and annoying. I had to force myself to go through most battles, like ""dammit, another gunfight"". Fighting bosses either left me annoyed or left no impression at all. It took me 3 minutes to kill the matriarch. It could be alright but shooting is ruined by the next problem:2 - Level design. It was magnificent in Gears of War 1. It had such memorable locations, well placed gameplay decisions. In this game it's not memorable at all and feels like playing a compilation of generic sci-fi maps. Open world levels are annoying and are a waste of time bc Gears of War used to be a corridor shooter.3 - the game is changed in support of leftist views and characters. Marcus Phoenix, who was judged for noncompliance, who would take risks to achieve goals suddenly judges his son for taking risks.Hammer of dawn is suddenly a weapon dangerous for people fighting locust. And the best part - boring main characters. No charisma whatsoever. I especially liked the scene where they meet war buddies and make a scene, like schoolkids, because one of them takes tasks and another is warming the bench.4 - ""I started using substance painter"" model quality. Some models have great detailization, some are absolutely horrible.Monster sounds are another disappointment, compared to berserk matriarch sounds like a squealing creature.This game made it obvious Coalition don't give a damn about the lore and do whatever they want.

444,Posted: September 11,1.4 hrs on record,"I was able to tell this game wasn't for me within the first few minutes of actually moving my character around, but I gave it an hour, and... I was only able to add to the following list of things I didn't like about it (in order of most disliked to least):- The forced head bobbing of the character with no ability to turn it off was making me sick. I found a way to disable to bobbing while sprinting, i.e. ""rodeo running"", but no option to turn off the view bobbing while walking around.- There is a distinct lack of visual feedback when firing at enemies. I had the game on ""experienced"" difficulty, and so maybe this was part of the problem, but I couldn't even tell if my bullets were landing on enemies until they actually died.- While sprinting, your controls turn into that of a car from a racing game. You get really low turn radius and can't strafe. It's cool for a racing game that's designed around it, but this is a FPS, which makes it feel really awkward.- I've enough spatial control in games to have topped leader boards in multiple FPS titles. Despite this, the doors, gaps, and even stairs I had to use to get on with the level took a minute for me to spot sometimes.- The guns were constantly running out of ammo, which once again may be due to me playing on ""experienced"" difficulty, but it felt very much like Breath of the Wild where I'd shoot a couple enemies then my weapon would be useless.- I killed myself in the campaign as soon as I was able to. I was just testing out the controls and threw a frag grenade out for fun. I then had to watch the opening cut-scene again with no ability to skip it.- The game gives you a robot pal to open doors, shine light, and pick up items that're far away. However, they spent way too much time highlighting this guy on the first level. I just want to play the game, and not watch a robot slowly do things.The game might have a lot of pros to it if you actually stick with it, but I was basically only able to see it as a massive list of cons during the first hour. I'm very critical of games being fun all the way down to movement. I always ask myself, ""is moving around fun in this game?"", and if it's a shooter, ""is shooting fun in this game?""

491,Posted: September 9,17.0 hrs on record,"The Gears of War series to me has the most amazing Action scene and heart-skipping moments.and Gears of War 5 is no exception as a Sequel.Gears 5 Campaign Story gives a classic Rollercoaster feeling (not a spoiler) just like all of it's predecessorshas great Script in terms of Dialogue and Story-Telling although to me it could've just been written betterI've finished the Campaign on Expert difficulty in about 15hrs at most and it was fun 8/10-------- SPOILERS AHEAD ---------------I really love the first Act, it was amazing especially with the Hammer of Dawn scene where then it goes to an ""Oh No"" moment real quick, like I said about how the Series really loves playing with Your emotions.2nd Act was to Me the Golden Key of the Storyline where Kait unravels almost everything about Her, who she is, who Her family is and why does She have the Locust symbol with Her, things are amazing and quite an interesting story, also it's just that I love the Tundra atmosphere / Terrain3rd Act was a bad one in My opinion, as the story is just too bland and predictable, there were not many things to see in Act 3 as it's just You and Your team finding a Rocket and Launching it onto space, although it's not as simple as what i've just said since You're up against hordes of enemies and things always went wrong just like usual. To Me the only interesting part of this Act is when You're up against Gears of War 5 version of Rift Worm from the previous series, and where it's being told that the Swarm is getting smarter for unknown reason, but We do know why (You'd know after Act 2) that's it, nothing else is good in My opinion.4rd Act, well this is where ♥♥♥♥ went real. Jinn wants Kait to go back to the Hivemind while Marcus says ♥♥♥♥ that.apparently the Sanctuary is being attacked by the Swarm and it wasn't just an attack as the Swarm Queen are going in with them along with the Rift Worm. ♥♥♥♥ went down real quick as everything turns to chaos and I swear to God this Act is so awesome, the kind of build up for an explosive peak, intense battle and heartpounding moment seing everything dies and destroyed and there's a cutscene after where Kait finally gets to meet the Queen and have a bit of a pep-talk where then ♥♥♥♥ goes wrong and You have to choose either to Save JD or Del, it was sad seeing one of Your friends die. and that's all until You run and climb up the Sanctuary Wall to finally fight the Gigantic ♥♥♥ Worm and sadly the story ended with Jack sacrificing Himself as Hammer of Dawn coordinate like what JD did back in Act 1.so to Me the ending is just too bad and it's an extreme cliffhanger, The Game started basically highlighting Kait about Her unraveling who She is and We don't even get to see it. Act 2 is the only Act where it's being spoken and that's it, We don't get to deal with the Queen or anything, the story for the least could've been like Kait going to the Hivemind to kill the Queen but something went wrong and instead awakened something even more Dangerous and it became an ""Oh No"" moment like in Final Fantasy 13-2 then just leave it like that for Gears of War 6, I mean that's bad but atleast not as bad as the Ending we got on this Series.",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

494,Posted: September 9,18.9 hrs on record,"I know a lot of people posting negative reviews about this are complaining about either the PVP or the microtransactions... I'm just gonna go over those real quick before I get into the actual review:-PVP seems to play like Gears 1-3 and perhaps even 4 (never played 4) but connection stability is finnicky for sure.-Microtransactions have been completely optional. Been playing for like 4 days before writing this review and have yet to see a forced paywall. They stay in the store section and appear on player choice as microtransactions should when they are present in a game.Okay now that that's outta the way...I've been playing Gears games since Gears 2. I've played every Gears game except 4 and enjoyed each of them for their own reasons. I haven't expected anything worthwhile since it left Epic's hands which may or may not seem weird nowadays. But Gears of War 5... pretty much combined everything I loved about previous Gears titles except PVP (but frankly outside of Judgement, I was not a fan of Gears PVP apart from Botmatches. Just wasn't ever my thing and never got the hang of it.) The story for the campaign, the enemy design, and the new Escape mode and take on Horde... I love it all. Horde feels like it hit new sweet spots while dropping a few minor charms, but I'm not complaining much. Everything still feels like Gears in terms of gameplay and storytelling style if nothing else. And based on what I'm hearing about Gears 4, this game is much better and probably compares to some of the games made under Epic's control.",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

503,Posted: September 10,36.8 hrs on record,"So this game is really fun with its pvp and pve and its campaign is amazing, and ultimately i feel like it was worth the price tag with its gameplay alone, which is what matters in the end, but i have a stack of criticisms/questions i wish the devs would answer and that i think most people should be aware of like why are there so few characters/weapon skins at launch? gears 3 and 4 had twice or thrice what there is right now, does this have to do with the locked/personalized horde/arcade classes and loadouts? (this will come up again in a sec)why are classes locked to characters in pve modes now? i dont see how this benefits anyone, we cant play duplicate characters in pve modes because of that, the way its structured we are incentivised to play characters based on their class and weapons instead of what character you just like, at least all the classes are good i suppose. If your a coalition dev, you cant just release characters as is either, you have to give them a personalized loadout for horde/escape and arcade mode, its an issue for both the devs trying to just put out characters as part of content and the players who just want to run around as their favorite character, where as being able to choose horde classes/arcade loadouts seperate from your character would be much more streamlined (in a good way, i really dont see any downsides aside from possible composition dupe spam). Aside from jack, who is most certainly a special exception, i just dont see the developer vision or whatever with these choices.Then theres the fortnite store (you know what that store format looks like) selling daily/weekly skins/items for real money, this is a mixed bag because sure you can just buy something that catches your eye without any lootbox rng, and honestly most ppl might just buy 2 or 3 things they like and probably never touch it again id wager, but then A) what is this doing in a full priced AAA game? and B) the disparity in item quality is the most outrageous thing ive seen in a while. For example, for 10 bucks i can either buy a decent looking weapon skin i can use on most weapons OR i can buy an emote that lets me say thanks and only 1 specific character can use it...what? in smash bros i can get a completely new character with a unique moveset and a bunch of music for 7 bucks, idk maybe im spoiled but i cant convince myself that most of these are good deals, this is assuming im not tilted that theres a fortnite store in a 60 dollar game in the first place btw.my last complaint is that you cant play pvp gamemodes that ARENT ranked with more than 3 people in a squad, why? most pre-mades dont go into social to tryhard or anything, they just dont, and if they do, a coordinated 3 stack is still going to have an edge anyways, halo reach and R6 siege let you squad into games with as many people as a team size allows, and those games have a bigger competitive scene if thats relevant, just saying.These guys made a good game ultimately so ill support them, i just wish they would at least humor us on the topic of these QOL/player choice/freedom downgrades.",No one has rated this review as helpful yet1 person found this review funny,Recommended

511,Posted: September 10,15.1 hrs on record,"This is a straightforward and spoiler free review of the Gears 5 campaign.First of all, this is a console port, however the PC version of the game is the definitive version of the title, The Coalition and XBox Studios have heavily invested in getting this mechanically right and the keyboard mapping and control schemes are exactly what you'd expect from a well developed product.While I will not talk about story elements, I will say that the campaign starts exactly were you left off with Gears 4. Now, many people on PC did not purchase Gears 4 on PC since the title was only available from the Microsoft Store. The Microsoft Store sells titles locked up in it's UWP delivery platform and unfortunately that is a major issue for many PC Gamers since it eliminates features and can cause problems with screens, drivers and overlays, not to mention that multi-GPU set-ups are just not supported within UWP. Thankfully the steam distribution package does not utilise Microsoft's terrible UWP system, instead offering a traditional file installer package.The game itself also contains the ""Easy Anti-Cheat"" client, so a word of warning, This product erroneously detects the Aura background process/service lightingservice.exe as a cheat, be warned that if you use Asus Aura then Easy Anti-Cheat will interfere with your games ability to launch. With respect to performance, I'd say it is a technical marvel. I have been running the title at 4K with the Ultra HD texture pack on an EVGA 1080Ti SC2 very happily, were it's hitting my card at about 78% utilisation and my CPU is being hit for about 25% Utilisation.However there are some optimisation issues, for example after a lengthy play session the game can momentarily freeze during rapid mouse movement. However, this issue is so infrequent that its almost non-existent and it may be related to the fact that there is no Nvidia Game Ready driver for the title as yet. I have heard from friends who have been having significant issues with the UWP build  of the game from Microsoft's Store when it is played on a machine with an RTX 2080Ti, however I haven't encountered the same issues with the earlier 1080Ti.The games environmental execution is nearly flawless, fantastically recorded and presented dialogue even though a lot of it is fairly par for the course in an action title. IT is still done brilliantly and the general banter of your comrades during missions is fantastic. Graphically the game sparkles, it's beautifully polished with some of the absolutely best configurable options anywhere. It comes complete with what has to be one of the bet in-game benchmark tools there are. With detailed explanations for what and how each setting affects visual quality and performance. Simply spectacular a very complete package.The game also features Microtransactions (I still find that term hilarious, there is nothing ""Micro"" about a $30 transaction) however the MTX's are not pay to play, and they are also not relevant to the Campaign, they are focused on skins and so on. Generally I don't mind MTX too much when they are not a part of a gambling mechanic nor integral to the gameplay, however I am not thrilled when I see a first party developer employ them in a title. I think Microsoft would do better to eliminate these from their titles to make their platform a more welcoming place for gamers of all ages. As they are they are in-offensive but also surplus to requirements.Well thats it really, an excellent port of an excellent game resulting in the PC being home to the definitive version of it. A masterpiece, let down only a little by a relatively trite story, but also packed with action and brilliantly executed play and combat mechanics. This is a contender for GOTY and no mistake. Well done Microsoft and The Coalition.",1 person found this review helpful,Recommended

516,Posted: September 10,9.2 hrs on record,"putting a game up with a full $60 price tag and adding mtx (optional) content is the meta; no matter how much people cry about it in reviews or post articles, companies don't give up their profits easily - especially when they have a massive team that has to be paid at the end of the month.the reason smaller studios with some of the massively successful f2p games (i.e. path of exile and league of legends) with mtx can sustain themselves is they are usually bought by a bigger company, by that point you don't even support a small studio but widen the pockets of the higher ups.but TF2 and CSGO were full priced games at some point in time as well, they had paid cosmetics and even worse, lootboxes/crates/packs. people didn't complain, they went along with it. hell, DOTA2 was f2p from the start and that had/has paid cosmetics too. i don't get why people protest Microsoft, Activision and Blizzard for employing such an old practice now. don't get me wrong, i would always prefer to be able to unlock skins etc. without paying in a full priced game, but without eliminating the CORE paying playerbase, changing the system is very unlikely.i would rather people criticize the game for the day-one wonky servers or whatever plethora of hardware issues they come across rather than mtx cosmetics (inb4 microsoft shill).personally, i'm delighted with the gameplay mechanics as i've never played a gears game before. cover system is fun and guns require more control than they do in many other FPS games (except for shotguns, i hate em). i haven't come across frame issues, graphics are great for the mid-to-high settings i'm using. insane difficulty is challenging but not that much if you're OK with dying a couple of times in a row like me.overall, fun game but you could always just buy it on sale.",2 people found this review helpful,Recommended

519,Posted: September 10,43.0 hrs on record,"Wow, i'm surprised. After gears 4, I thought the series would be on a stead decline, but the Campaign was amazing. Once again though, The Coalition has no idea how to deal with weapon skins and characters for multiplayer. There's only like less than 20 characters for multiplayer at launch, and you can unlock skins for each one. Gears 3 had a ton of characters available from the very start, along with fun ways to get new weapon skins. There's no season pass, and apparently ""new content"" every 3 months, although we're yet to see what that will actually mean for the game. Definitely a step up from Gears 4 so far, the multiplayer maps aren't that great, and horde seems a little downgraded from the gears 4 version, i'm not sure why they didn't just keep it the same and add some new stuff. Your character being tied to your class is a bad idea, you shouldn't have to worry about who you play as. On a positive note, this is some of the best graphics and performance I have ever seen out of any game. It pre-set itself at 4K max 60FPS on my 1080ti, and it stayed there for all of campaign, I still haven't adjusted it. All in all, the game will probably get better with the next update, gears 4 was like this, gears 3 was like this. Is it acceptable? No, but this game has a pretty bright looking future.

Escape feels too short, and the game feels like it is lacking a few weapons, characters and Possible items such as more Horde fortifications (Silverbacks and Turrets, for example) But most games these days tend to break up content to release as DLC later down the road.I'd give it about an 8/10. Campaign goes on longer than most FPS games these days if you don't rush through all the main missions and with several different game modes to hop into, there's enough there for a 'long lasting' replayability. Depending on how fast updates roll in.",1 person found this review helpful1 person found this review funny,Recommended
521,Posted: September 9,9.3 hrs on record,"The game in itself is great so far from what I've experienced with playing early and all; however there's a few things that bothered me that I hope are taken care of soon.Such as the cutscenes in the campaign that are far quieter than they should be dialogue-wise, meanwhile the music is blaring over them. This doesn't happen to all cutscenes in the game, but a fair amount of them. It's like the volume of the characters is relative to the camera, so when you hear one character talking they may sound fine, then it would pan over to another and you can't tell what they're saying without subtitles.I was also quite disappointed to say the least that for the playable characters, there weren't many(10 on each side if you didn't get Ultimate Edition and did not play Gears 4); at least for a Gears of War game. I grew up on these games with the feeling of having many options of what I could play as. I know they're doing the whole ""Battle Pass"" esque system to release content. All I really want to do is play as one of the Carmines in multiplayer/horde. Also for whatever reason two people can't play the same character in quickplay versus, but competitive/ranked allows anyone to play anything.Even with my picking out little things like these from this game, that may matter more to others; it is still enjoyable. Obviously this is subject to change as the game goes on, but for now it's a good game. I would personally wait a bit because there is a lot that could happen with this game in month's time. So please do yourself a favor and wait for a sale, where the price-tag is a bit less hefty.TL;DR The game is good, not as enjoyable as previous titles and not worth the $80 I spent on the game. However, I still enjoy the game at the moment; that's why the review is positive. Please wait for a sale if you aren't 100% sure you want to hop into this game.",1 person found this review helpful,Recommended

533,Posted: September 9,18.9 hrs on record,"I know a lot of people posting negative reviews about this are complaining about either the PVP or the microtransactions... I'm just gonna go over those real quick before I get into the actual review:-PVP seems to play like Gears 1-3 and perhaps even 4 (never played 4) but connection stability is finnicky for sure.-Microtransactions have been completely optional. Been playing for like 4 days before writing this review and have yet to see a forced paywall. They stay in the store section and appear on player choice as microtransactions should when they are present in a game.Okay now that that's outta the way...I've been playing Gears games since Gears 2. I've played every Gears game except 4 and enjoyed each of them for their own reasons. I haven't expected anything worthwhile since it left Epic's hands which may or may not seem weird nowadays. But Gears of War 5... pretty much combined everything I loved about previous Gears titles except PVP (but frankly outside of Judgement, I was not a fan of Gears PVP apart from Botmatches. Just wasn't ever my thing and never got the hang of it.) The story for the campaign, the enemy design, and the new Escape mode and take on Horde... I love it all. Horde feels like it hit new sweet spots while dropping a few minor charms, but I'm not complaining much. Everything still feels like Gears in terms of gameplay and storytelling style if nothing else. And based on what I'm hearing about Gears 4, this game is much better and probably compares to some of the games made under Epic's control.",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

In my opinion chainsaw could still be b as you hold RB anyway so change it to hold B and press B to knife.-Cant play any character you like in any game mode. characters are directly tied to their respective class for some reason-Horde classes were changed for the worse for some reason.

565,Posted: September 9,23.9 hrs on record,"Far better than 4, that's for sure. Story's more interesting, and far more memorable. Kait's not really good as a protagonist, though. This game gives more genuine reason to like JD, and it just makes you wish the campaign was focused more on him like the last game was. Not to say there isn't reason for kait to be the protagonist of this one, though. There certainly is, and it does affect the story nicely. But good lord, does it try too hard to make you sympathize for her when she doesn't have a likable personality to fully warrant such sympathy. rest of the story though....its a bit special, this game. The multiplayer's just fine, same as it always is, with some new maps to freshen things up, and new weapons to try out. Customization's not bad, either. Its a small step-up from 4, and it does the job. (In mulitplayer, they brought back voices to congratulate or shame you upon winning or losing rounds of a game. Gears 4 lacked this, and it can burn for that. This is an important detail I thought you people should know.) Escape mode's fine, with it being a decent time-waster with friends, and Horde mode's always a treat. New bosses for the boss waves never disappoint. This game's a pretty good packaged deal for people that wanna find something to waste time on. I get that some may be turned off to this game because of how much pandering there supposedly is to certain groups but, putting that stuff aside because I just ignore it, there's a genuinely good game here.

They story has a suprising amount of downtime for a shooter. Your not just rushing from arena to arena all the time. A large majority of the story mode is walking around, picking up and reading collectibles , as well as just listening to characters interact. Of course there is also more than enough of the bloody combat, but there's good downtime between each encounter to keep it feeling fresh. POSITIVES:- Good story and characters- Fun environments and weather effects during fights (especially fights where you can drown enemies by breaking the ice under their feet)- Large weapon variety-Improved close quarters and melee -Classic Gears of War goreCons:- Difficulty can increase drastically (From normal fights to bosses that kill you in one hit)- Boring stealth mechanics (How can anyone be stealthy in that armor!?)",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

580,Posted: September 10,15.1 hrs on record,"This is a straightforward and spoiler free review of the Gears 5 campaign.First of all, this is a console port, however the PC version of the game is the definitive version of the title, The Coalition and XBox Studios have heavily invested in getting this mechanically right and the keyboard mapping and control schemes are exactly what you'd expect from a well developed product.While I will not talk about story elements, I will say that the campaign starts exactly were you left off with Gears 4. Now, many people on PC did not purchase Gears 4 on PC since the title was only available from the Microsoft Store. The Microsoft Store sells titles locked up in it's UWP delivery platform and unfortunately that is a major issue for many PC Gamers since it eliminates features and can cause problems with screens, drivers and overlays, not to mention that multi-GPU set-ups are just not supported within UWP. Thankfully the steam distribution package does not utilise Microsoft's terrible UWP system, instead offering a traditional file installer package.The game itself also contains the ""Easy Anti-Cheat"" client, so a word of warning, This product erroneously detects the Aura background process/service lightingservice.exe as a cheat, be warned that if you use Asus Aura then Easy Anti-Cheat will interfere with your games ability to launch. With respect to performance, I'd say it is a technical marvel. I have been running the title at 4K with the Ultra HD texture pack on an EVGA 1080Ti SC2 very happily, were it's hitting my card at about 78% utilisation and my CPU is being hit for about 25% Utilisation.However there are some optimisation issues, for example after a lengthy play session the game can momentarily freeze during rapid mouse movement. However, this issue is so infrequent that its almost non-existent and it may be related to the fact that there is no Nvidia Game Ready driver for the title as yet. I have heard from friends who have been having significant issues with the UWP build  of the game from Microsoft's Store when it is played on a machine with an RTX 2080Ti, however I haven't encountered the same issues with the earlier 1080Ti.The games environmental execution is nearly flawless, fantastically recorded and presented dialogue even though a lot of it is fairly par for the course in an action title. IT is still done brilliantly and the general banter of your comrades during missions is fantastic. Graphically the game sparkles, it's beautifully polished with some of the absolutely best configurable options anywhere. It comes complete with what has to be one of the bet in-game benchmark tools there are. With detailed explanations for what and how each setting affects visual quality and performance. Simply spectacular a very complete package.The game also features Microtransactions (I still find that term hilarious, there is nothing ""Micro"" about a $30 transaction) however the MTX's are not pay to play, and they are also not relevant to the Campaign, they are focused on skins and so on. Generally I don't mind MTX too much when they are not a part of a gambling mechanic nor integral to the gameplay, however I am not thrilled when I see a first party developer employ them in a title. I think Microsoft would do better to eliminate these from their titles to make their platform a more welcoming place for gamers of all ages. As they are they are in-offensive but also surplus to requirements.Well thats it really, an excellent port of an excellent game resulting in the PC being home to the definitive version of it. A masterpiece, let down only a little by a relatively trite story, but also packed with action and brilliantly executed play and combat mechanics. This is a contender for GOTY and no mistake. Well done Microsoft and The Coalition.",1 person found this review helpful,Recommended

585,Posted: September 10,9.2 hrs on record,"putting a game up with a full $60 price tag and adding mtx (optional) content is the meta; no matter how much people cry about it in reviews or post articles, companies don't give up their profits easily - especially when they have a massive team that has to be paid at the end of the month.the reason smaller studios with some of the massively successful f2p games (i.e. path of exile and league of legends) with mtx can sustain themselves is they are usually bought by a bigger company, by that point you don't even support a small studio but widen the pockets of the higher ups.but TF2 and CSGO were full priced games at some point in time as well, they had paid cosmetics and even worse, lootboxes/crates/packs. people didn't complain, they went along with it. hell, DOTA2 was f2p from the start and that had/has paid cosmetics too. i don't get why people protest Microsoft, Activision and Blizzard for employing such an old practice now. don't get me wrong, i would always prefer to be able to unlock skins etc. without paying in a full priced game, but without eliminating the CORE paying playerbase, changing the system is very unlikely.i would rather people criticize the game for the day-one wonky servers or whatever plethora of hardware issues they come across rather than mtx cosmetics (inb4 microsoft shill).personally, i'm delighted with the gameplay mechanics as i've never played a gears game before. cover system is fun and guns require more control than they do in many other FPS games (except for shotguns, i hate em). i haven't come across frame issues, graphics are great for the mid-to-high settings i'm using. insane difficulty is challenging but not that much if you're OK with dying a couple of times in a row like me.overall, fun game but you could always just buy it on sale.",2 people found this review helpful,Recommended

588,Posted: September 10,43.0 hrs on record,"Wow, i'm surprised. After gears 4, I thought the series would be on a stead decline, but the Campaign was amazing. Once again though, The Coalition has no idea how to deal with weapon skins and characters for multiplayer. There's only like less than 20 characters for multiplayer at launch, and you can unlock skins for each one. Gears 3 had a ton of characters available from the very start, along with fun ways to get new weapon skins. There's no season pass, and apparently ""new content"" every 3 months, although we're yet to see what that will actually mean for the game. Definitely a step up from Gears 4 so far, the multiplayer maps aren't that great, and horde seems a little downgraded from the gears 4 version, i'm not sure why they didn't just keep it the same and add some new stuff. Your character being tied to your class is a bad idea, you shouldn't have to worry about who you play as. On a positive note, this is some of the best graphics and performance I have ever seen out of any game. It pre-set itself at 4K max 60FPS on my 1080ti, and it stayed there for all of campaign, I still haven't adjusted it. All in all, the game will probably get better with the next update, gears 4 was like this, gears 3 was like this. Is it acceptable? No, but this game has a pretty bright looking future. I purchased it to support the gears series being on steam.",2 people found this review helpful,Recommended

600,Posted: September 9,18.9 hrs on record,"I know a lot of people posting negative reviews about this are complaining about either the PVP or the microtransactions... I'm just gonna go over those real quick before I get into the actual review:-PVP seems to play like Gears 1-3 and perhaps even 4 (never played 4) but connection stability is finnicky for sure.-Microtransactions have been completely optional. Been playing for like 4 days before writing this review and have yet to see a forced paywall. They stay in the store section and appear on player choice as microtransactions should when they are present in a game.Okay now that that's outta the way...I've been playing Gears games since Gears 2. I've played every Gears game except 4 and enjoyed each of them for their own reasons. I haven't expected anything worthwhile since it left Epic's hands which may or may not seem weird nowadays. But Gears of War 5... pretty much combined everything I loved about previous Gears titles except PVP (but frankly outside of Judgement, I was not a fan of Gears PVP apart from Botmatches. Just wasn't ever my thing and never got the hang of it.) The story for the campaign, the enemy design, and the new Escape mode and take on Horde... I love it all. Horde feels like it hit new sweet spots while dropping a few minor charms, but I'm not complaining much. Everything still feels like Gears in terms of gameplay and storytelling style if nothing else. And based on what I'm hearing about Gears 4, this game is much better and probably compares to some of the games made under Epic's control.",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

I prefer compaign over multiplayer, and bought this game for single player compaign which doesn't disappointed me.So far it's the best Gears compaign in the series for me, loving every bit of it. It's also great that they finally experimented with some open world elements which are refreshing. New take in story is also promising and I don't know why people are complaining about performance issues , this is the best optimized game for me on pc so far. I have gtx 1060 6GB and getting solid 60 fps constantly using recommended(Ultra/High) settings at 1080p resolution. For Gears fans it's a treat from coalition and they clicked every box in this installment. There is no doubt that pc community is getting toxic every day and it's quite visible from some negative reviews. We don't allow developers to experiment and easily criticize them on initial release either based on new take in old franchise or for few issues in online server etc. For it's initial release it has best performance to offer when compared to other products of same category , for all the negative reviews I can only say that get some life and stop ♥♥♥♥♥ crying over small issues which will be fixed eventually.Finally it's a must play game for those who love gears single player challenging compaign.

623,Posted: September 9,23.9 hrs on record,"Far better than 4, that's for sure. Story's more interesting, and far more memorable. Kait's not really good as a protagonist, though. This game gives more genuine reason to like JD, and it just makes you wish the campaign was focused more on him like the last game was. Not to say there isn't reason for kait to be the protagonist of this one, though. There certainly is, and it does affect the story nicely. But good lord, does it try too hard to make you sympathize for her when she doesn't have a likable personality to fully warrant such sympathy. rest of the story though....its a bit special, this game. The multiplayer's just fine, same as it always is, with some new maps to freshen things up, and new weapons to try out. Customization's not bad, either. Its a small step-up from 4, and it does the job. (In mulitplayer, they brought back voices to congratulate or shame you upon winning or losing rounds of a game. Gears 4 lacked this, and it can burn for that. This is an important detail I thought you people should know.) Escape mode's fine, with it being a decent time-waster with friends, and Horde mode's always a treat. New bosses for the boss waves never disappoint. This game's a pretty good packaged deal for people that wanna find something to waste time on. I get that some may be turned off to this game because of how much pandering there supposedly is to certain groups but, putting that stuff aside because I just ignore it, there's a genuinely good game here.

627,Posted: September 9,17.0 hrs on record,"The Gears of War series to me has the most amazing Action scene and heart-skipping moments.and Gears of War 5 is no exception as a Sequel.Gears 5 Campaign Story gives a classic Rollercoaster feeling (not a spoiler) just like all of it's predecessorshas great Script in terms of Dialogue and Story-Telling although to me it could've just been written betterI've finished the Campaign on Expert difficulty in about 15hrs at most and it was fun 8/10-------- SPOILERS AHEAD ---------------I really love the first Act, it was amazing especially with the Hammer of Dawn scene where then it goes to an ""Oh No"" moment real quick, like I said about how the Series really loves playing with Your emotions.2nd Act was to Me the Golden Key of the Storyline where Kait unravels almost everything about Her, who she is, who Her family is and why does She have the Locust symbol with Her, things are amazing and quite an interesting story, also it's just that I love the Tundra atmosphere / Terrain3rd Act was a bad one in My opinion, as the story is just too bland and predictable, there were not many things to see in Act 3 as it's just You and Your team finding a Rocket and Launching it onto space, although it's not as simple as what i've just said since You're up against hordes of enemies and things always went wrong just like usual. To Me the only interesting part of this Act is when You're up against Gears of War 5 version of Rift Worm from the previous series, and where it's being told that the Swarm is getting smarter for unknown reason, but We do know why (You'd know after Act 2) that's it, nothing else is good in My opinion.4rd Act, well this is where ♥♥♥♥ went real. Jinn wants Kait to go back to the Hivemind while Marcus says ♥♥♥♥ that.apparently the Sanctuary is being attacked by the Swarm and it wasn't just an attack as the Swarm Queen are going in with them along with the Rift Worm. ♥♥♥♥ went down real quick as everything turns to chaos and I swear to God this Act is so awesome, the kind of build up for an explosive peak, intense battle and heartpounding moment seing everything dies and destroyed and there's a cutscene after where Kait finally gets to meet the Queen and have a bit of a pep-talk where then ♥♥♥♥ goes wrong and You have to choose either to Save JD or Del, it was sad seeing one of Your friends die. and that's all until You run and climb up the Sanctuary Wall to finally fight the Gigantic ♥♥♥ Worm and sadly the story ended with Jack sacrificing Himself as Hammer of Dawn coordinate like what JD did back in Act 1.so to Me the ending is just too bad and it's an extreme cliffhanger, The Game started basically highlighting Kait about Her unraveling who She is and We don't even get to see it. Act 2 is the only Act where it's being spoken and that's it, We don't get to deal with the Queen or anything, the story for the least could've been like Kait going to the Hivemind to kill the Queen but something went wrong and instead awakened something even more Dangerous and it became an ""Oh No"" moment like in Final Fantasy 13-2 then just leave it like that for Gears of War 6, I mean that's bad but atleast not as bad as the Ending we got on this Series.",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

Escape feels too short, and the game feels like it is lacking a few weapons, characters and Possible items such as more Horde fortifications (Silverbacks and Turrets, for example) But most games these days tend to break up content to release as DLC later down the road.I'd give it about an 8/10. Campaign goes on longer than most FPS games these days if you don't rush through all the main missions and with several different game modes to hop into, there's enough there for a 'long lasting' replayability.

631,Posted: September 9,9.3 hrs on record,"The game in itself is great so far from what I've experienced with playing early and all; however there's a few things that bothered me that I hope are taken care of soon.Such as the cutscenes in the campaign that are far quieter than they should be dialogue-wise, meanwhile the music is blaring over them. This doesn't happen to all cutscenes in the game, but a fair amount of them. It's like the volume of the characters is relative to the camera, so when you hear one character talking they may sound fine, then it would pan over to another and you can't tell what they're saying without subtitles.I was also quite disappointed to say the least that for the playable characters, there weren't many(10 on each side if you didn't get Ultimate Edition and did not play Gears 4); at least for a Gears of War game. I grew up on these games with the feeling of having many options of what I could play as. I know they're doing the whole ""Battle Pass"" esque system to release content. All I really want to do is play as one of the Carmines in multiplayer/horde. Also for whatever reason two people can't play the same character in quickplay versus, but competitive/ranked allows anyone to play anything.Even with my picking out little things like these from this game, that may matter more to others; it is still enjoyable. Obviously this is subject to change as the game goes on, but for now it's a good game. I would personally wait a bit because there is a lot that could happen with this game in month's time. So please do yourself a favor and wait for a sale, where the price-tag is a bit less hefty.TL;DR The game is good, not as enjoyable as previous titles and not worth the $80 I spent on the game. However, I still enjoy the game at the moment; that's why the review is positive.

If you haven't played any of the new gears the meta is a tad different, lancers in multiplayer are a lot more viable now while still maintaining the fun shotgun action we all know and love.

646,Posted: September 11,9.3 hrs on record,"After the preorder fiasco in China, the unmentioned region block that didn't exist during the preorder period, the lack of information during the events that occurred, im tempted to give the game a hyper critical review based upon these blundering mistakes and lack of foresight. However, the games campaign is a delight to play and has so much depth from the characters to the world itself.The connectivity issues that plague the games other modes however have kept me from giving you a proper review as it just gets locked on a permanent load screen after the lobby process is completed. That includes horde mode (why the hell is this an online feature) , escape and obviously versus. Buy the game if you have the patience for the devs response time to these bugs. P.s if you're in China and you happen to buy this from the Chinese steam store- you are not prepared....

653,Posted: September 11,5.9 hrs on record,"Ive been enjoying this game so far. I would really wish for changes to horde mode allowing anyone to choose who they want to be skin wise and a class second. But right now, there seem to be issues with the new nvidia drivers. I didnt have issues with the august 27th drivers but the new driver specifically made for gears 5 seem to be having issues. Game crashes and audio cut outs seem to be the big ones with me so far. I also dont know if updating windows 10 will fix the issues because im already hearing new reports of the latest version of windows having trouble with the start menu. You see, back then when gears 4 came out, i had to completely update windows 10 for it to work. But now since this is steam i assume it should work on any version of 10. It says it also works on windows 7 but not many people are on 7 for games anymore. Until then, i am waiting for an update either to gears 5 or nvidia drivers to make this game more compatible. So for now, my rating is a strong 7.5/10. Still very early in campaign but ive tried out the other modes as well and are pretty fun.",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended
654,Posted: September 11,1.4 hrs on record,"Finally - Gears has hit Steam, and it's truly glorious.Graphics are AMAZING. I've had zero optimization issues, went right in on full ultra 1440p and get over 100 FPS at all times. Had a few friends with lower spec PC's and the game ran amazingly for them as well.The story is top notch. Probably one of the best Gears campaigns since 2 or 3. Gears 4 was such a weak installment in my opinion and I'm so glad they went all out for this one. There are a few large ""Open world"" environments that you explore on your skiff. These areas have side quests, collectables, secret weapons and locations. It adds so much more to an already amazing story. And the campaign is 3 player co-op now with one player being Jack, the support robot on the team.The multiplayer is a huge step forward as well. In Gears 4 it was really only viable to use your Gnasher in fights. Lancers didn't do enough damage let alone any of the other regular weapons. In Gears 5 however EVERY gun is viable. Lancers can headshot now, guns have punch and feel good to use. You'll see A LOT more Lancer use in Gears 5, so prepare yourself if you're coming from Gears 4. The crossfire is real boys. The sound design is incredible as well. Fights are 10x more intense than they were in Gears 4.All in all I think it's safe to say that this is my favorite Gears game out of them all. I'm not a fan of the new ""supply drop"" system and the way the store works, but I can get past it because the rest of the game is such a blast to play, and none of that stupid stuff gets in the way of that.Also a PSA for anyone new to the Gears scene : The multiplayer is VERY competitive. The Gears community knows the ins and outs of MP, wallbouncing, switch peaking and crossfiring are all tactics you'll really want to learn before going in. But once you get those down the multiplayer is SO much fun when looking for a very competitive MP game.",1 person found this review helpful,Recommended
