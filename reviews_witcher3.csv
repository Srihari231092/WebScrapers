0,Posted: September 11,71.9 hrs on record,"My gosh... I have to say, I'm BLOWN AWAY!I've never really been into RPG's, but I decided to give this game a go as I had heard so many good things about it-- I was honestly hooked, and I can proudly say this game is worth it's full price, and is easily one of my favourite games of all time!The Story:The story follows Geralt of Rivia, a Witcher, as he hunts for an Elven girl, Ciri, who is at danger of this supernatural 'army' known as The Wild Hunt. With plenty of twists and turns, and so many outcomes, this game has some of the best replay value I think I've ever seen! Your choices genuinely do matter, whether it's dialogue options or how you tackle a certain quest or contract-- There are plenty of different endings from what I've heard-- the one I had was INSANELY emotional (I got one of the bad endings).. I'd happily replay the entire game to see everything it has to offer! The voice acting is generally really good, however there are a few pacing issues towards the beginning I feel, as the game starts off quite slow... this definitely picks up though, and in style!The Gameplay:Melee combat is fluid, locking on to enemies and slashing through them feels satisfying, especially with the amazing effects and levels of detail... you can slash bodies IN HALF with your sword/decapitate them in battle, and it's a good balance of fun and difficult-- it's easy to learn and hard to master.Unfortunately, I hated the crossbow controls, at least with kb+m it was really hard to get an accurate shot, and it was quite useless (at least to me).. That's one of the very few flaws in the game's combat.It is a third-person game with great storytelling and an amazing amount of stuff to do. I've never really liked RPG's for how tedious they could get-- but for some reason, I enjoyed all the inventory menus, equipping and upgrading weapons, brewing potions and bombs, and generally just making Geralt look badass!As well as the main story, the player can complete Witcher Contracts, Side missions, A card game called Gwent, the player can eat, drink, swim, go hunting, search for treasure, destroy monster nests, take back bandit camps, ride boats, participate in horse-races, or brawls, or random encounters-- They're all different and I'm pretty sure there's something for almost everybody to enjoy! The customisation is also quite in-depth, from different armor affecting Geralt's appearance, to the ability to get haircuts and shaves-- The hair and beard grows back in realtime too which is a nice touch.Controls:The game is fairly smooth to control when on foot and in combat, however I feel they can occasionally get really clunky and unresponsive when on horseback, which has had me frustrated a few times.Also, I've found that the mouse sensitivity is insanely high, and even when I scaled it to the lowest it went, it was still super high-- this could be a glitch, or the sensitivity is broken... Going back to awful crossbow controls, the high sensitivity makes things even harder and more frustrating.Graphics:This game is gorgeous! It's honestly one of the best looking games of 2015, and doesn't look so bad today, 4 years later! Some areas have aged more significantly than others, such as the low res textures, and the horrible, stretchy grass/foliage movement... but other things look amazing, and better than most games out today! From the way that water reacts to Geralt's movement, to the beautiful sunsets and the bright colours... It may not be the most realistic games, but it has a slightly stylised look to it, and I love it! I especially loved the detailed buildings, the dense crowds and the insane levels of detail by the time I got to one of the larger city areas, Novigrad. The Map:The map is MASSIVE in this game... I've completed the main story and almost all of the contracts-- I still feel like i've barely explored the entire map because it's just so vast and easy to get lost in-- but this isn't a bad thing as the world is so breathtaking that you'd actually want to get lost!",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

3,Posted: September 11,148.4 hrs on record,"BEST GAME EVERRR !!!! No exaggeration, witcher 3 is a master piece and its as good as its reputation. At a time when a lot of game companies are running after the moolah with comments like ""sInGle PlAyeR gAmeS aRe dEAd"", CD Project shows us how to really make a game than the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t thrown at us by EA and Ubisoft. The map is huge and the storyline like any other. This is my favorite game and its made by my favorite developer. And better yet, the game is really cheap. The game looks stunning, even by today's standards there are few games which come close to the beauty of Witcher 3 renders. The game contains a lot of side quests, all of which have a good story background unlike the repetitive stuff in AC.",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

7,Posted: September 11,59.6 hrs on record,"- Graphic: Big world and beautiful enough (not too much detail compare to other triple A games as this game is already 5 yrs old), you will feel that every step of yours is a journey to the new places- Details: Superb (there are plenty of small meaningful details which you can notice through the game like books); also you can enter most buildings, houses to find for loots (better 100x times than Assassin's Creed games)- Story: Super deep and thrilling, the best part of the game, the story ingame (including side quests) is well-written and made with love. You may not have ever seen anything like this game and may be won't- Gameplay: Not too bad with most players, various kinds of playstyle: Alchemy, upgrading gears, potions,... mainly around rolling, dodging, countering and using spells. But with veterants, the gameplay is quite easy once you have enough equipments- Controlling: Swimming, sailing, shooting crossbow, moving (without changing it to alternative mode) are so clunky and not as good as I expected- Bug: There are still some bugs during the game (rarely), but you can reload the auto save to solve them most of the time- Most annoying things in the game: Stupid Roach, you can whistle all day but she won't give a ♥♥♥♥ about you; Stupid way-guiding, sometimes it would lead you to a locked door or somewhere else but not the right entrance)Though this is still the game I love most in my library and the most amazing game I've played in my entire life. 100% worth the original price on GoG for this masterpiece",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

34,Posted: September 10,169.0 hrs on record,"This was my introduction into the Witcher universe and I was blown away. Where do I start when reviewing the this game? The story telling and writing is great, characters are well written, cut-scenes are beautiful even 4 years later. Dialogue actually matters and you get to see consequences to them either right away or subtly along your travels. Dialogue:(Spoilers) One example of such a great dialogue is when Geralt is in White Orchard hunting a griffin. You come across a healer named Tomira; in her home with a wounded girl, Tomira tells you that she's done everything she can for the girl but she doesn't have much time left. You are given two options, either let the girl die slowly and peacefully, or give her one of your swallow potions (healing potion) to heal the hemorrhaging in her skull. However the catch to this is that the swallow could potentially make her death much more painful. If you chose to let her die you will get no xp and the quest ends after killing the Griffin and leaving White Orchard; But if you give Tomira the potion she will thank you and give you a reward. After you finish fight and kill the Griffin, and leave White Orchard; if you return to White Orchard and visit Tomira in her hut she while inform you that Lena had started recovering but was taken away by Nilfgaardian Soliders heading towards Velen. After you leave White Orchard and arrive at the Nilfgaardian camp in Velen you are greated by a solider who confronts you about saving Lena. He tells you that she barely functions, recognizes no one, and sleeps most of the day. Geralt responds with the line, ""Trust me- the choice I had to make was harder."" This is arguably one of the first hardest choice that requires you to make a tough decision. This quest perfectly illustrates one of the best aspects of Witcher 3 and that is its Side quests/ side content. You will spend hours hunting for rare and dangerous monsters, searching for lost treasure, solving petty squabbles between townsfolk, or saving villagers from an untimely demises. The main story gives the game a sense of urgency but the side content makes the main story feel even more complete once you finish.Conclusion:This game has a lot of content and will give you hours of entertainment if you have the time to do so. The characters and setting seems very faithful to Slavic folklore which its based on, almost all of the creatures, magic, and spells are drawn from polish mythology. All in all this game is fantastic and I recommend anyone who has yet to play this game to give it a go and immerse themselves in the Witcher universe.",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

53,Posted: September 9,12.5 hrs on record,I really wanna try and get into this game but playing on the hardest diffculty was my biggest mistake.But even so playing on a hard diffculty should not have things like infinte health werewolfs and other bs.I constantly need food everytime I fight any creature and even pouring in alot of time into side quests and other things I still have absoutley nothing to my name and am only level 3!I also dont understand the levels of enemies.Some enemies are level 6 and are easy to kill some are level 2 and are hard as ♥♥♥♥.The tutorial told me that red bar enemies are dangerous but every enemy is like that so I'm not even sure what the ♥♥♥♥ to do.I like grindy games because after you put in the effort and time into those side quests and other things you have an easier and more relaxing time playing the game.Fighting any creature seems like a waste of time as they dont give any exp unless its in a quest. Theres also quests for the card game they have which are just completley stupid as I'm not interested in having to learn a completley different system in order to do a couple of quests.Granted they are no mandatory it still seems like they could have replaced them as it just seems like a marketing strategy to get you to play Gwent which again have no interest after my awful experience.,No one has rated this review as helpful yet1 person found this review funny,Not Recommended

68,Posted: September 9,76.5 hrs on record,"I guess I should start by saying this game is very well made, beautiful, and I actually do recommend it to people.  If you're a fan of open world action rpgs then this game is right up your alley.  In fact the only reason I'm thumbs downing it is because its highly overrated.  It's a good game by every standard.  But it is by no means the best game.  Many of the side quests are repetitive go here, investigate, track, kill monster, repeat.  And there are many side quests to get side tracked on which severely slows down the pace of the main story, but most open world rpgs have this problem.  The story is forgettable and nothing special.  The voice acting is borderline bad but thats not a big concern to me personally.  The combat is solid, but rather bland and nothing special.  Since you play as Geralt, its hard to roleplay as anything other than the gary stu that is Geralt, IMO a game like this would be a thousand times better if you made your own character and had more choices other than nice response, mean response.  While at first I didn't care much about the characters that clearly had a long history with one another, they did slightly grow on me and I have become a little more interested in their pasts.  Maybe if I had played the first two games I would feel differently, and I think I will go back and play the first twoWhere I think this game shines the most is in the world and world building/lore itself, and gwent of course.  It's really cool to see all the different monsters, ghost, and specters, and to learn about them.  The controls are really solid, other than swimming.  Novigrad is probably one of the best medievil cities out of any game I've played.  I feel like I listed more bad things about the game than good, but really all those ""bad"" things are just things that are found in any normal game.  I would have expected a highly acclaimed ""10/10"" game to blow me away and be a little bit different than other normal games.  Anyway, it's still a good game and anyone that likes medievil action rpgs should probably check this out, you will probably like it.TL DR:  Good solid game, would recommend, but highly overrated (which is why I gave it a thumbs down, too many thumbs up reviews).And I'm giving this game a 6/10, maybe 7 I'll see how I feel later (Please note that I'm very conservative when giving ratings, with a 5/10 being neutral, meaning there is usually nothing notably special about it).",3 people found this review helpful1 person found this review funny,Not Recommended

That is how I felt when playing the whole witcher series.. the Story is great and the world is vast. I cannot say anything negative about the Witcher 3.

97,Posted: September 8,0.2 hrs on record,"it's the best game I've played in my life. It's main strength is the story.. The emotional connection a player has with all the characters while playing this game is unimaginable!

The world is so detailed that you could spend hours immersed into it. It's also is full of activites which is breathtaking actually.The gameplay is also considerably well considering it has so many other strong plus points. The sound and the voiceovers are to the point. The soundtracks are one of my favourites.All in all, if you want to experience the best game created to date, play the Witcher 3. But do remember, you wouldn't easily enjoy any other game after playing it (It's that good). You may have other opinions about it, but this is just mine.

112,Posted: September 7,230.1 hrs on record,"a high 9/10 well polished, rich in content, nice visuals, extraordinarily well crafted characters, lots of different enemies, branching story, good music, superb voiceacting, big open world that's fun to explore, dialoge options with real impact on how things play out, interesting fantasy creatures. The game likes playing with your expectations and surprises often. Most if not all characters are both good AND evil; same applies to your own character so there is no black villains and white knights. The lines are blurred and some interesting choices and stories arise from that. The witcher has all the boxes ticked. A lot of work went into this. The writing is pretty good. The dialogues are written very well too. Asset re-use is reasonable and rarely do you find rooms being copy pasted without at least some minor changes. Apart from the loot-containers you barely notice asset reuse.  It's a real pitty not more games like this are coming out. Yes, it's almost as good as everyone says it is. Complaints are so minor i won't even list them. Highly recommended game. You won't regret buying this even outside of a sale. If you plan on really sinking your teeth into it choose the second highest difficulty as that's the setting you get most play out of. On lower difficulty you might notice half way through it's too easy and since difficulty affects the speed at which you gain XP cranking it up later is useless.",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

I've found this to be a little repetitive but the fanboys  love it.Verdict:This isn't a bad game but it does have flaws. There are a lot of CD Projekt Red fanboys who defend this game to the death and ignore the problems - so don't believe every positive review. If you don't like dialogue, then this game isn't for you.

142,Posted: September 6,3.6 hrs on record,"After playing this on console, I decided to take another stab at it in higher graphical fidelity on my PC. That was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. After a mere two hours of play, I’ve come to see why this game won so many awards for just graphics alone. The sway of the trees, the grass that bends beneath your feet, and the hundreds of NPC’s that roam larger settlements like Novigrad and Oxenfurd. Besides visuals, the story is a masterpiece and the lore trumps even that. There is immense attention to detail in every crevice of these massive open worlds, small stories that play themselves out in the nooks and crannies of the continent. Characters are highly expressive with mostly well synced dialogue and great voice acting. The protagonist is expressive and even funny and witty. The only weakness is the combat which can get very repetitive and the unnecessary weapon repair system makes me want to avoid fights more than anything. Combat makes Geralt feel floaty instead of like a strong warrior with actual weight to him. Compared to the other elements this is just a nitpick, the real issue comes with the main storyline which feels a bit bloated with all sorts of fetch quests, half of which I forgot after delving into side quests like the assassination of Radovid and the selection of the kind/queen of Skellige. Or a quest to cure a werewolf, solve a case to find a serial killer, race horses, accept Witcher contracts. The world is vast and requires hundreds of hours of exploration to truly complete. CDPR is one of the better developers but their crunch on their employees is also a real issue that must be addressed.

From there I went around looking for cards. Good omen. Maybe Gwent will keep me invested long enough to like the game more. Characters are just so damned boring. I do like geralt though.

Others have described the level of customization you can expect, but in the end a game needs to have a good story and interesting characters. Witcher 3 has both, and Geralt really grows on you as you guide him though the story.",1 person found this review helpful,Recommended

178,Posted: September 5,171.9 hrs on record,"Geralt of Rivea; or How I learned to Stop Worrying and Love Quen.As of writing this I have 171 hours logged and I've finished the main game and the expansions. Now that I'm an adult I don't have the attention span or energy I used to have for games. It's very unusual for me to sit down for over an hour and give my attention to a game. The Witcher has really captivated me and kept me engaged in a way that has been truly memorable, challenging and fun. The characters are all very well written and I felt genuinely curious about what was going on in the story. Geralt has some great lines in the game and I really enjoyed listening to him grow with his friends and other characters in the world. I really did begin to feel for the characters in the world and became invested in their success, it was a fun ride.CD Projekt Red has put a LOT of attention into building the world here, it's hard not to notice it. I felt so engaged with exploring the world, I hardly used fast travel throughout my playthrough, only towards the end of the game did I start to use it frequently. This world truly captures that ""what's over that hill there?"" magic that most open world games fail to. I could spend hours just running from point of interest to point of interest in order to see all the curious bits of content tucked away all over the map, waiting to be seen. Combat feels balanced and engaging. I recommend fighting in the 'brawler' events posted around in some cities & towns, it will give your a stronger sense of how to maneuver Geralt effectively. The magic is just plain fun, once you upgrade it  enough. Also, I highly recommend researching all of the potion/decoction/bomb recipies that you can get your hands on, they definitely come in handy later on and can augment your spells to great effect. I don't think I ever got bored or annoyed with the music in this game, it was pleasant and fitting all throughout. Lots of folk type music with strings, vocal chants and drumming. Overall, I didn't find any one part of the game annoying or dumb. The game is a grand fantasty action RPG with a dark tone and mature topics but it dosen't take it's self too seriously, it still manages to be self aware in some parts and lighten up with needed. In my eyes this is a classic and I'm sure I will come back to play it again in the future. Also, it remains a favourite topic amongst my gamer friends, we all adore it!If you're a fan of the RPG genre I definitely recommend this game!",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

197,Posted: September 4,110.6 hrs on record,"The Witcher 3 is, undoubtedly, one of the best games I've ever played. It's a masterpiece that deserves every ounce of praise it gets.My complaints number precisely two: The implementation of horses is clunky. I spend more time fighting with my horse to get it to do the simplest of things than I do actually riding it. Also, combat is a bit of a mixed bag. When just dealing with mobs and normal fights this isn't a big deal, but harder enemies prove to be a fight both against them and the controls.Beyond this, I have only positive things to say about the game. There's a very good reason it's 4 years old now and still regularly topping the charts. The story is long, gripping, and massive; the world is breathtakingly lush and full of adventure or scenery at every turn, and visuals are absolute top-tier. Few games offer such an amazing experience as does TW3 and it's an absolute pleasure to pick up and play. It's one of the few games that I would unabashedly give a perfect 10 out of 10.

The game focuses on many touchy subject, but through all the blood and guts, you find a game with a good heart, which tries to make you smile at any opportunity. Behind Geralt's scared face and harsh, raspy voice is a kind soul who loves his friends, a misdirection that informs the whole series. As you find yourself taking part in stage plays, stumbling through the show as the notes you wrote on your hands become smugged. As well as allowing a ghost to posse you so he can attend a wedding to impress a girl he fancies. I could go on and on.The Witcher 3 was one of the biggest surprises I've ever had playing a game.

236,Posted: September 3,317.3 hrs on record,"The best part of this game is story. I play many great rich-story games, but none of them can beat Witcher 3. Drama, romance, funny mystrery, thriller, horror, many feelings combine together. Long speaking dialogues and cutscenes.The books and documents in this game are also full of story in it. Every quest even minor ones are filled with great stories, distinguish itself from each others. The choices you choose, the ways you speak or act effect the story line in game a lot. Scenery and music are also wonderful, could make you cry. The combat is very good, fun, enjoyable but can't say it's the best one. There are many games I've played better than Witcher 3. I know horse's bugs in this game are hilarious and could be famous meme. No offense but horse riding is suck! The horse get stuck on every thing even the thin air you can't see. Riding is awful give you disadvantage in combats.This game is NOT SUITABLE for gamers who like GRINDING, killing monsters/enemies, doing same things over and over. Because you level and make money from quests and contracts which have different stories, missions, and things to do. You cannot expect what's gonna happen next. The DLCs are pretty big, long and great stories. I feel like I play another big game of Witcher, so I recommend you buy the GOTY edition that including the base game and all DLCs. Worth every cent, penny, baht or whatever your currency is. You can mod in this game, yet I don't reccommend in you first playthrough. You should experience the original of the game before trying anything else. By the way, I never mod any games. However, it's single player.

261,Posted: September 2,189.0 hrs on record,"Pretty much a must play if you're a fan of Action RPGs.  In my opinion, however, TW3's strongest aspects are world immersion, gameplay, and story, in that order.  Immersion:  pay enough attention to the game world around you, and you see all the little details that have no impact on gameplay whatsoever, but make the world feel more real.  For instance, walk around the city of Novigrad for a while.  On some of the sloped roads around the nicer parts of town, there are rainwater drainage trenches in the streets that run into the sewers so the lower parts of the city don't get flooded.  That's the sort of attention to detail that I like to see in games.Gameplay:  my favorite aspect of gameplay is using witcher senses to track someone or something.  It goes a long way to make you feel like a real monster hunter.  The combat is good - nothing groundbreaking but neither is it dull (it does sometimes have sharp difficulty spikes, though, so don't get cocky).  Conversations can be a bit tricky:  the game prompts you with what the gist of what Geralt can say, but sometimes what the prompt says isn't at all what Geralt actually says, so occasionally conversation choices are misleading.Story:  the story is definitely interesting, but unlike the first two witcher games, you'll be a bit lost at times if you've never read the books or at least Geralt's wiki page.  For instance, the game sets up the Wild Hunt as the big bad guy(s), but never explicitly tells you what the Wild Hunt is until the game is all but over.  It's not tremendously important that you know exactly what the Wild Hunt is early on, but it would still help to know.  Fortunately, the game does a better job handling Ciri, who wasn't mentioned at all in Witcher 1 or 2.As for flaws, the game does have them, but they're mostly minor.  Horse racing, for instance, is completely one-sided:  your horse can run out of stamina (and thus cannot gallop forever), but your NPC opponent horses have unlimited stamina.  Winning long horse races comes down to cheap tricks like blocking your opponents when your horse runs out of stamina.  Gwent (the in-game card game) has a similar issue, when your opponent seems to always know what cards you have and magically has the perfect card to counter it.  There are also a few flaws to immersion:  witchers are supposed to have superhuman dark vision (and thus only sparingly need to use Cat potions), but have absolutely no dark vision whatsoever in TW3.  Geralt also seems to really enjoy randomly rolling down stairs for no reason.  These are really my biggest gripes though - that's how good the game is.",2 people found this review helpful,Recommended

263,Posted: September 2,169.2 hrs on record,"This game isn't perfect, but holy ♥♥♥♥ it's damn near. There's already like 200,000 positive steam reviews for this game so I doubt anything I say will be something you haven't heard before, but seriously, just get the ♥♥♥♥ing game. The story is amazing, the gameplay is solid enough, the crafting is actually pretty fun to try and complete, and your actions genuinely have consequences within the world, which *really* improves the experience. This game has a LOT going for it. I still have a couple of gripes, namely:- It's somewhat awkward to play with a keyboard and mouse, especially when you come across a bandit camp with like 50 boxes to loot that are all stacked with each other. It takes so much longer than it needs to just to loot stuff because it's a game made for consoles. It's not a huge issue, but kind of irritating. - Some potions are only obtainable if you pick a certain path in some quests.  For example, there are only 2 possible dopplers that you can kill and get the necessary mutagen for the potion, but in both cases it's kind of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing to do so you might want to spare them. I did a full playthrough and still don't have some of the potions simply because I chose a certain path. It's not the worst thing in the world but it's still annoying - Skellige is, without a doubt, the worst area to explore in the entire game. Hell, I'd argue that finding everything in this are is an experience on par with Far Cry 3's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t collectables. There are something like 60 or 70 water chests in Skellige. More than half of the marked locations in the area. Every one of them is the exact same thing. Sail out to this part of the ocean, swim around and loot the 3 chests that are floating there. You have to do this SO MANY TIMES. Sure, you can ignore it, but it's *really* annoying having a bunch of locations shown on your map where it is impossible to tell whether its something interesting or just the same 3 floating chests for the billionth time. ♥♥♥♥ I hate it. Every other area is so fun to explore but with skellige they just copy and pasted the same ♥♥♥♥ing thing 60 times and called it a day. Ok, rant over.Honestly though that's all I can think of. In the *entire* game, these are the only 3 things that spring to mind when I think of the negative experiences I've had. Everything else about this game is amazing. Seriously, just get it. Especially the DLC. One adds an amazing story that'll pull on the heartstrings of even the most stone-hearted of people (heh). The other adds a ridiculously large area that could basically be counted as its own game (as well as a solid story). Everything about this game is worth the full price (you also get a bunch of free DLC which is nice). Seriously, just buy the damn game.",2 people found this review helpful,Recommended

I'm sure this world was crafted with as much love as detail. The story by itself is amazing, there's consquences to what you do and choose troughout not only the main story but side quests.

The music is amazing. The visuals are breathtaking. Gwent is by far the most fun card-based minigame of any game out there. And the story.The Witcher 3 has a truly superb story that takes you on a one-of-a-kind adventure that rivals anything else. The characters are all unique and interesting. The relationships are all complex and dynamic. And this is complemented by absolutely stellar voice acting and stunning facial animation. And its not just the main quest. There are many side quests that are memorable, too, e.g. ""Where the Cat and the Wolf Play,"" ""Wild at Heart,"" and ""Last Wish.""Also, I'd highly recommend both of the expansion packs, ""Hearts of Stone"" and ""Blood and Wine.""

There are certain missions that definitely progress the story when needed. However, before you find that mission you will have to take on missions at random to see if you are going in the right direction.  This does give you the ability to thoroughly explore each land, but it does tend to drag on. Also, most of the time you may not be at the right level to progress in story. Thus, you'll have to grind your way to level up. You'll also be distracted by multiple favors and side quests. In the end a great game.

320,Posted: September 1,222.5 hrs on record,"Ok so finally i am gonna write a review about this masterpiece and yes its gonna be very long soall TL;DR people am just gonna tell you all that this game worth every cent you owe to this, thats all So lets just begin with the entire franchise, you won't believe me if i tell you,i played witcher 1 and 2 just a few months ago just to play this, i don't mind old games tbh as long as its gold , each game in this franchise has its charm, am not saying there is nothing negative about it, there is but its not that noticeable, as the story and soundtracks masks it,So WITCHER 1Idek if you guys believe it but i loved witcher one more than all the parts,idk why perhaps its because of the intense in the story? or its because it gave me some nostalgia feelimg? or perhaps its just the soundtracks? idk but i enjoyed playing witcher one LIKE ANYTHING, i played it for 15 hours straight man am not even joking it was that interesting, but the thing it has some very flawed combat system, but it wasn't that much of a big deal at least not to me, so lets give witcher 19/10So Witcher 2ahhh lets just say in my opinion the game was WAY Too short to even enjoy anything, or complete any achievements or even understanding the twist, they improved the combat system which was technically ""hard' on many occasions, sometimes you die by even a silly harpy, but they changed the entire combat mechanism, like in the obvious thing you all know, in witcher 1 you can actually drink potions, during a combat, and it lasts for too long,  but in witcher 2 you gotta get prepared before the combat even begins, during a combat you can't use potions, i mean i understand thats how it is in books and its kinda reality, but you can also kept it like this, like you can use potions during a combat but it will only gives you half of its effect, more realistic right? but anyways perhaps its like each time when you make a potion the witcher has to do all the herbs and mixture thing i guess, idk but apart from that the story WAS very massive still i find witcher one screenplay a lot better than this, and also they cut off many small animation, like eating? sharpening the blade? these gestures on witcher 1 was really amazing to me on that period of time, but anyways it was good, not the best so overall 7/10So Witcher 3so lets just say AM VERY IMPRESSED BY THE WHOLE GAME through out the gameplay, the locations, the maps, the story, the dialogues, the humor, emotions, quests EVERYTHING is a masterpiece, i enjoyed every bit i played on 200+ hours, it has some minor bugs which is barely even noticeable, and they also changed the combat system from witcher 1 and witcher 2 and witcher 3 has a lot of difference, but witcher 3 was a way better than any of it, and also what i enjoyed the most is geralt sarcasm its very hilarious on many timings, xD So lets just in DLCS i don't really think it gave that much impact to me because to me playing the DLCS just dragged the game a bit more, i felt like the story wasn't that good on BOTH DLC Heart of stone and Blood and wine, but it has its good moments now and then, but i always felt like it was way too rushed, so overall 9.5/10so yes I completely request all of you who read this review to play witcher the whole franchise , not just one not just 2 not just 3 complete the whole game in order, which is when it will give you the impact like it did for me <3thank you CD PROJEKT for this masterpiece",13 people found this review helpful,Recommended

This is one of the greatest RPG's ever made, if not the greatest, and is also in my top 2 favorite rpgs of all time.You play as Geralt, a witcher who is trying to save his daughter Ciri from the wild hunt. Sounds pretty boring right? Just your average guy saves daughter from bad guys story. Wrong. The Witcher 3 may sound simple in concept, but the lore and story goes much deeper than that. While playing through the game you get to see a vivid world that has been created by the devs, and every area you go into has it's on story to tell. So while you follow the main storyline, you end up playing the mini stories that are the side quests, and trust me, some of these side quests feel like they could be normal story-line missions. Hell, even the tracking missions are interesting, and we all know how boring ubisoft makes those. Every character and every place just has so much rich story to them, with amazing graphics and voice actors to help make this world come to life.The gameplay and combat is relatively simple, and easy to get. However, it is hard to master as the difference between a good player and a bad player will show during difficult battles. Playing on the easiest difficulty is a cake walk, and I would recommend playing one of the harder difficulties throughout your first playthrough unless you are a complete beginner.  The mutation and skill tree is interesting and unique and provides you with different play styles and attacking opportunities.Then finally, the graphics are amazing, and very pleasing to the eye. The world has beautiful mountains and forests and the towns feel real, down to the grimy sewers, up to the rich upstates.Everything about this game is damn good and if you dont have it already, I have no clue what you are doing. It is a must buy, even at full price. PS The DLC's are so good they could be considered full games.",1 person found this review helpful,Recommended

The graphics are amazing, the dialogue is captivating and I find myself enjoying all quests even the secondary quests. Since i am a Linux gamer, I especially love the fact that this game runs flawlessly on Linux thanks to Steam Proton. The only gripe I would say on this game (and it's minor) is the quest tracker on the mini map can sometimes be inaccurate and cause frustration. Overall though, this game is amazing and highly recommended. 9.9 / 10.",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

367,Posted: August 30,681.7 hrs on record,"The Witcher 3 is a game that will never get old and has undoubtedly earned its place as one of the best video to ever have been made. The combat is unique as it is very fast and works better than perhaps any other RPG out there. My advise is that you should not play the game on any of the lower two difficulties and you should stay on either Broken Bones or Death March (the two highest difficulties out of the total four) to give you the best variety of game play. And I do mean it when i say there is a HUGE variety of different monsters to fight all requiring different combat techniques to conquer them last time I counted there was over 40 different monsters and that is not including the different human and non-human enemies.The story is bar non one of the best I have ever seen, infact the only other game I can think of that has characters just as interesting and with perhaps better voice acting is The Last Of Us. 10/10 in my opinion the best video game ever made.",2 people found this review helpful,Recommended

374,Posted: August 29,74.7 hrs on record,"yknow, there are few single player adventure games that grab and ♥♥♥♥ing bear hug my interest so aggressively that id go through several more hours to relive that same experience that made me so invested in it for so long. one of these games is witcher 3. for me, the main strength of the game is its story and the characters that are entangled in it. every character is unique, interesting, and sometimes hilarious (my favourites are geralt, ciri and dandelion). the story has multiple endings based on your decisions in the game that will affect the overall outcome, and even the side quests feel just as important as those in the main quest. the story has a simple enough plot; a witcher, geralt,  is hired by the emperor to track down his daughter, ciri, and bring her back to him. though it may seem simple at first, the more you sink youre teeth into the game, the more complex and interesting it becomes. during this search, you encounter people who have their own ties to ciri but also their own backstories. a good example would be the bloody baron, whose ptsd from the battlefield causes him to turn to alchoholism which causes his family relationship to fall apart. in regards to gameplay, its surprisingly in depth. youre a witcher, meaning you get paid to kill monsters. you accept witcher contracts, kill the monster, and get paid. but theres more to it than that. see, each monster is unique in the way that each one requires a different strategy to defeat. once you learn about what youre up against, you can then view it in the beastiary and prepare whatever potions or oils you need in order to kill it. on top of all that, the visuals and graphics are just.... wow. cdpr went above and beyond with how the game looks. whats more amusing is that through my 70 hours of playtime (during the time of me writing this) and with such a big, open, detailed world, i have not once experienced a crash or bug. the only real complaint that i have with this game is that the movement can be kind of awkward and itll take some getting used to, but its not detrimental to the overall gameplay.in summary, BUY THIS GAME10/10 - actual masterpiece",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

Exploring game maps is an exciting experience in itself. Look for treasures under the water, exploring dilapidated buildings, battling a bandit, or fighting bloodthirsty monsters.

393,Posted: August 28,120.2 hrs on record,"Foreword-Did not get into this game when I first purchased it two years ago, but with the recent hype over the new Netflix adaptation I decided to check it out once more. With a little patience and an open mind I found something that I haven't had in a long time; that being a complete and overwhelming drive to get completely immersed in a game's universe, lore, characters, politics, everything. I bought the ♥♥♥♥ing books, needless to say, I'm in deep. Review-The gameplay is super solid and has a lot of rpg elements. However, they are somewhat shallow in the sense that you do not have a ton of options when it comes to weapon variety/stylized gameplay. If the gameplay does suit you though, it can be super intuitive, even has this somewhat hard to explain rhythm to it just like a fighting game, where you can spam buttons if you want, but the best tactic is to play footsies with the monsters and when they give you an opening you go for the throat.The graphics are outstanding on a good PC, can be a lil buggy sometimes. Also, lotta pretty nice boobies.Story: At this point I have not finished the story but am truly well enveloped in it, but still the side quests and exploration hold me back.Exploration: This game delivers on rewarding exploration and bold moves, meaning if you go to a place that is reccomended for a slightly higher level but you manage to skate your way by, you will not be disapointed. For example, just recently I found an abandoned castle left in ruins, within it was a level 30 cyclops, which is a formidable enemy for my being level 22 and all. However, after a long fight that almost cost me a lot of replay time due to not saving before, I was rewarded by the diagrams for the master level upgrades of the armor set that I have been using. Complete chance that it happened like that. But moments of exploration that are suprsisngly rewarding like that make for an experience that I can keep coming back to over and over again.I could go into more depth about the crafting and alchemy and character stuff but that's for you to find out. This game does have some clunky elements to it and of course the occasional bug that is to be expected from a big title. Overall a nearly flawless experience, I cannot wait to start new game plus on the hardest difficulty. 9.5/10 Good Luck on the Path",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended
394,Posted: August 28,129.2 hrs on record,"For the longest time I didn't play this game. I thought The Witcher 1 was interesting but the combat was odd (I know everyone says that), The Witcher 2 was pretty cool but I really could care less for the story so I dropped it midway through. So I held off on W3, even though I kept hearing how amazing it was everyday.Well I'm here to just say that its pretty good, and the DLCs are the best I've played probably ever, truly deserving of the name expansion. Gwent is a really fun sidegame and it felt like I was also playing a yugioh game along with the hacky slashing. Combat could've definitely been deeper but the story is enjoyable and keeps you playing until the very end. Give it a try, and if you're bored do something else. What I mean by that is so many people nowadays are like ""well I gotta do these sidequests, farm this, and kill 25 ____ before I can do the thing I really want to do"".  It doesn't have to be that way, do whatever you want. Give yourself more freedom and you'll enjoy side content heavy games better I promise.8/10",1 person found this review helpful,Recommended

I don't mind a few short clips now and again to facilitate a good story but this is full on next level crap.  For some folks you may love this kind of experience.  I absolutely hate it.

DISCLAIMER I have not played the Previous 2 Games or read any books, The review is coming from the perspective of a guy who only knows Witcher lore from this game.The Witcher 3 is a great gameafter several years of wanting to play this game, hyping it up for myself after reading too many reviews, even after setting myself extremely high expectations for this game, i can confirm that it still fu*king SMASHED all expectations and at one point made me binge play it for 3 near-sleepless nights in a row. its crazy how good this game is, many times i found myself at 2am saying to myself ""yeah ill finish this one quest and go to sleep, i cant keep playing so late"", just to find myself still playing at 5am about to finish the fifth quest.I would like to say, even though the game has ""Wild Hunt"" in its name (which has nothing to do with hunting animals as you would find out an hour or so into the game), it is very much a story driven game, the combat in the game (while still very enjoyable) is not the main focus, i see too many reviews calling The Witcher 3 an overrated game, with their main reason being that it is a Combat focused game with below average combat. You would only need to play a few hours of the game to realise that everyones absurdly high hours played on their accounts come from the huge amount of cutscenes and dialogue you will encounter, not only in the main story but even just doing contracts or side missions.Speaking of Contracts and Side Missions, lets start the Bullet Point part of the Review.Quests, Side Quests, Contracts and anything else Related -The game, as stated above, has an amazing story, most of the story is told in dialogue, which i found to be written very well.The best i can explain how the Dialogue/Cutscenes work in the game, i would have to say it combines cutscenes with dialogue choices and quick time events.(i think masseffect has the same kind of thing, but ive never played any of those games)When talking to any character related to your quest, or having to choose an action (e.g whether or not to let someone out of a cage, which would awake a beast if done so)  you will be put into a cutscene type environment, where you are unable to move and watch as the NPC talks to you about whatever is happening, after the NPC asks a question, time stops and you choose your answer, sometimes in a stressful scene the game will give you a timed dialogue choice, if an answer is not chosen in a set amount of time the game will pick randomly between the options and the cutscene will keep going with whatever outcome was picked.The choices in Dialogue or Actions Dont end the cutscene, there is never a wrong answer when picking dialogue options, but the choices themselves will typically influence how a mission will play out, and rarely can impact how later missions play out, most of the time this would just be getting different dialogue, honestly i have only played through the game once so im not 100 on how much different choices influence later missions, but i had watched videos on youtube of different choices and how they influenced missions, and it didnt seem like a quest was locked or anything like that.The main story in the game has around 57 quests, which can be played in approx 70 hours, but let me remind you that the 70 hours is only the main story, there is a dumb amount of Contracts and Side quests in the game, The side quests might aswell be mini dlcs, most of these are just as fun and detailed as the main quests in the game, while the contracts are what you would expect a side quests would be in other games,You will find Monster Contracts on Notice Boards in Villages or Towns you find throughout the game, these contracts typically call for you to come to their village to let them know you accept their contract, you can negotiate your pay, before getting more info about what kind of monster you will need to kill and where you will find it, or atleast the place where people have been going missing, if the latter the game will ask of you to use your witcher senses and find the monsters nest, you will ofcourse then kill it and come back to the contract issuer with the head of the beast to collect your reward.Completing all Side Quests and Contracts in the game, while also exploring all Question Marks on the map will takes Hundreds of hours, i mostly stuck to the main quest and completing all Main Story Character Side missions as those get failed after the last couple Quests are completed, so my playtime isnt absurd, but if i would 100% the game im sure i would rack up atleast 200hours.Combat, Character Levels, Upgrades and SignsThe Combat has similar mechanics to Dark Souls, with the Hit Dodge Hit Dodge gameplay, just The Witcher is much more forgiving for getting hit and being able to heal. Different Armour Weight classes give different Stats and Buffs, e.g Light armor allowing better stamina regen (dodging more often) and higher fast attack damage, with lower defense stats.When it comes to weapons, you will get a Steel Sword, Silver Sword and a Crossbow. The Steel Sword is honestly fairly useless as it comes with similar stats to the Silver sword, and is unable to deal damage to Non-Human enemies, the only thing the Steel Sword slot has going for it is being able to use Unique Weapons such as Maces or Axes, and in later DLCs you gain access to Special weapons that go into the Steel Sword slot, but most of the time throughout the game you will be using the Silver Sword.While in combat you are also able to use Signs, Signs are, with a lack of words, Special Moves. there are 5 Signs available to you in the game, those being Quen, Yrden, Igni, Aard and Axii.The Quen sign is a passive shield that blocks one attack from any enemy.The Yrden sign is a magical ring which can be placed on the floor, which weakens Magic Enemies.Igni is a blast of fire that has a chance of setting some enemies of fire and stunning themAard is a blast of... Waves? Air?... it pushes enemies away, sometimes knocking them down allowing for a quick executeand finally, Axii, a sign which messes up the targets mind, stunning or confusing enemies when used. All of these can be upgraded with Skill Points you get with leveling up or finding places of power, upgrades can change the way your sign works, or just make it stronger.These Skill Points can obviously be also used to upgrade damage from different types of attacks, Effectiveness of Armor types, etc.Throughout the game you will also find special rune stones, which can be placed in slots on armor and weapons, these will give special buffs, such as a chance to cause burning, or additional armor piercing.Map and ExplorationThe Witcher 3 has an enormous map, I wont be talking on the DLC maps as i just dont have enough spaceThe map has 3 Regions, White Orchard, Velen and Skellige.White Orchard is the first region you will play in and the smallest one, there isnt much interesting in it so ill just use my left over space for more detail on the next two regions.Velen is a Much larger region and has most of the Main Quests in it, it is filled with Explorable points such as caves or Side Quests, marked as Question Marks on the map.This is the region you will spend the most time in.Skellige is the last region of the Game and is similar in size to Velen, The final quests are played here. Just like Velen it also has many explorable points of interest, there are many caves and side quests, but most question marks will be in the middle of the ocean in the form of buried treasures.In terms of looks, Velen is Very Swampy, and houses The Huge City Novigrad,While Skellige is a region full of Islands and Beautiful Snowy Mountains.I was going to type much more about these regions but i dont have enough spa[ 8 ] - Ambience/Charm[ 8 ] - Gameplay [ 9 ] - Visuals [ 9 ] - Music [ 9 ] - Story",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

430,Posted: August 26,45.0 hrs on record,"[EN] It's Witcher 3, so it is physically impossible to give it a fair bad rating. One of the best games I've played. Combat is solid, graphics are amazing on most settings, story is immersive and of course it has one of if not THE best character in gaming: Geralt of Rivia! If you have the money and a PC or any other electronic box that can play games and isn't a potato try this game it's worth the price and time, and if you don't have that much in your steam wallet just wait until the next sale. Also you should buy the GotY edition because the DLC's are essential for the full experience. 10/10 would search for Ciri again.[PL] Jest to Wiedźmin i w dodatku trzeci, więc znienawidzenie tej gry jest fizycznie i psychiczne niemożliwe. Jedna z najlepszych gier w jakie grałem. System walki jest solidny, grafika wyśmienita na większości ustawień, fabuła jest bardzo mocna i oczywiście w tym dziele sztuki jest Geralt co oznacza automatyczne dziesięć na dziesięć. Jak posiadasz komputer lub inny sprzęt do odpalania gierek to Wiedźmin 3 jest dla ciebie ( ziemniak to nie komputer btw ) i dla pełnego doświadczenia kup wszystkie rozszerzenia.

434,Posted: August 26,1.0 hrs on record,"It is an overall great game, huge in content, looks amazing and the story telling is just great.My biggest issue however are the rather clunky controls, specially in combat. The ""lock"" on system is a serious handicap, and even if you don´t lock on you are often stuck with weird auto lock on choices that specially when engaged with larger crowds makes bad choices.The core gameplay, controls of witcher 2 have been way better and less clunky, even so similar to some degree. Can´t say i ever felt so restricted or frustrated with this type of lock on controls in witcher 2 as i am at times in witcher 3.And while i love that enemies to not upscale with your level, by default cause it defeats the point of leveling, the random placement of various level monster/random engagements on the map sure as hell take away the interest to explore till you have a certain level.Entering a level 5 quest just to run into level 10 bandits on your way there is not really ""good"" game design. Also kinda ruins the immersion, if you just happened to single handily take out a griffin just to then get mopped up by a bunch of +10 level higher bandits... in what world will a bandit ever be stronger then a griffin.",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

Very realistic character design, there is no black and white its all shades of grey.I first bought it on GOG on release and later got it for Xbox One and also for Steam (because i have my real library here and i want all games in one place)This game doesnt become good because of mods by fans (if you know what im talking about). The graphics is still exquisite especially in the second expansion Blood and Wine. Speaking of DLCs, the DLCs are also the best you can get for the price both Expansions together were i think 30€ on release and the first one is around 20h average playtime and the second one is around 40h.The combat system is not as good as Dark Souls but most important it does not stand out negativly so even tho it could be better it doesnt pull down all the perfect parts of the game",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

Am looking forward to Cyberpunk 2077 which is more my cup of tea. ReviewBought this game on PS4 tried getting into it but the game didn't get me hooked. After i sold my PS4 and moved to PC i decided to give it another go so i decided to buy The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Game of the Year Edition again to see if i'll enjoy the game. Played for 14 hours got up to the first griffin fight (the furthest i gotten in the story), finished the quest and returned back to quest giver and after that i didn't continue from there. So my second attempt did't go well so one day i might give the The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt another shot. Third times a charm ?I don't really like fantasy games all that much but i did't regret buying The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt a second time simply because am supporting CD Projekt Red.performanceThe game ran well on my rig 980ti (not overclocked)i5 6600k (not overclocked)16GB RAM DDR4 (not overclocked)@1080pI got a stable 60fps at ultra setting but i turned down nvidia hairworks simply because it quite demanding.",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

446,Posted: August 25,210.1 hrs on record,"I am not gonna say this is the best game ever made, but it's clearly my favorite one. Before i played the Witcher games i read all Sapowski's books and i fell in love of this wonderful universe. I was afraid that thee witcher games would represent poorly the complexity of Geralt's universe and characters and what a ♥♥♥♥ing surprise i got. Even if i think that Assasins of Kings catched and has to this day the most even representatation of the witcher universe, Wild Hunt is full of life and is clearly the best witcher to date and and outstanding game. It is full of references to the books, excellent developing of characters, and have jaw dropping landscapes that i only have thought could exist in my imagination. It is a VERY extensive game so if you are commited to follow throughout the entirety of the thinga that you could do you will lost your mind in this masterpiece. It has is flaws like any game obviously (especially the combat system) and a few bugs but it will be really unfair from me to say that this things affect the experience, because it doesn't.

447,Posted: August 25,94.8 hrs on record,"The King of role playing games This will be a three part review. Right now I am at about the halfway point. (Asked a friend who has played the game before) I will return to this review once I have finished the game and once I have finished the DLC. Buy this game. If you are just looking for a ""yes"" or a ""no"" this game is a YES. I bought this game on a sale and now I wish I didn't, even at full price it is a steal. Each quest is so well done. Every freaking quest. I'm not much of a completionist. However, the side quests are so good that I can't help but do every single one of them that I find. The story is interesting and I am super invested. The characters are great and distinct. Just thinking about one of them makes me feel a flurry of emotions. The story is great and presented great. The graphics are stunning. The music is well done and knows when to take center stage and when to stay in the background. The combat is good, it allows each player to find what they enjoy about it and focus on that. The voice acting is good and everyone is voice acted. The game is huge! I am about 90 hours in now and I can't wait to put in more. Basically everything is good but I am staying for the quests and the storyline. Each quest feels natural and is a joy to complete. The storyline is interesting and feels real. This game will put you in spots where there is no ""right"" answer and you have to make the call. It approaches some hard topics and does them great justice. There is a reason this is known as one of the greatest games ever made. I am only halfway through but I am inclined to agree.",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended
448,Posted: August 25,124.7 hrs on record,"I suppose I should proclaim what this game is: It's amazing. But like with any game that's large in scope it's bound to go wrong somewhere, and Witcher 3 does go wrong in a few places actually. The impression this game's fanbase conveys is that The Witcher 3 is a flawless, perfect game. In my humble opinion there's no such thing as a 10/10 game. That score indicates something's perect but nothing is. Some games are very close to a 10, that is to say above 9. For my rating system though I never use decimals. The best:Setting/Immersion: This is CDprojekt's first open-world game and they did an incredible job. I loved this world. I adored the landscapes and the sunset, I loved the livelier cities, I loved the smaller villages and the occasional hut in the woods. This is a world that's alive, not empty like many other open-world games. I found myself lost at times just wandering, showing how this game can immerse you so easily. The last time when I felt like this was with Skyrim in 2011. Pro-tip: turn off as much of the HUD as you can for maximum immersion.. Graphics: This is hands down the best looking game I've played so far and I only played on custom high. When you look out at the sea when i Skellige, when you're in the woods in Velen when it rains and the wind is blowing is beautiful. The character models and animation too look amazing, which is especially commendable because RPG games often have bad facial animations. Here the characters express believable emotions, lip-sync well with speech and Geralt especially look amazing when he's fighting.Soundtrack: The music is some of the most original I've heard in gaming. I absolutely love that Slavic and Northern European folk music inspired this soundtrack. The combat music in Velen will be stuck in my head forever - Forged in Fire, Commanding the Fury, The Song of the Sword-Dancer and of course Steel for Humans... and ...Silver For Monsters. Then there's the expoloration tracks. The Oxenfurt and The Fields of Ard Skellige theme are by far my favourites. All other music is great but it is not as memorable. Story]: What's so typical for many games nowadays - fetch quests, extremely Pavlovian and lacking much thought - are not present to Witcher 3 to a large degree. Here to quests take on a life of their own. For example, a fork in the main quest will lead to a completely new secondary questline, a simple contract will turn in to a story in and of itself etc. It's fun and rewarding but most importantly it's chaotic, just like the world you play in, and real life itself which makes it more believable. Admitedly you'll easily get a bit lost in the story if you don't keep up at all times. On top of that there are a ♥♥♥♥-ton of characters you'll meet. The story and the world did though interest me more than the characters. I think The Witcher 3 is an example of a game where the whole (the story and the world) is greater than the sum of its parts (characters) (An example of a game where I think the opposite is the case is Mass Effect). Not to say that the characters are bad, some are interesting and gripping. But seriously, the side quests are more fun and rewarding than the main quest ffs. The Baron's questline was freaking awesome with a bittersweet conclusion, the quest where you meet Gaetan seriously surprised me by how good it was despite being so simple. Gameplay: Arguably the most improtant part of the game. The Witcher 3 is very fun to play. I've played for 115 hours in 3 weeks and I'm not done yet, I want to keep playing. The problems I had in Witcher 2 are fixed here. You have so many more items now, the inventory management is better, your inventory capacity is not fixed, you can actually increase it; You don't have to meditate for alchemy or leveling up, it's only reserved for waiting and replenishing potions; The leveling-system is deeper here, you only being able to have certain perks active at a time encourages more experimentation, hence more role-playing. Yes, some perks, especially in the General tree, are pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ which is a bit of a nuisance when you need to have allotted a certain amount of points in a perk tree to unlock other perks. Not a big deal though. And the combat makes you feel like a complete badass, granted you play well which leads me to the bad things...The worst:Minor things: It's pretty weird hearing THE SAME GOD DAMN dialouge throughout the entire game. ""You like that silver?"", ""Is a material world and I'm a material girl"", ""You'll choke on 3 pounds of steel"", ""Top-notch swords!"". I know the developers can't have an infinite amount of dialouge the NPC's recite so I can forgive this. Then there are some bugs and glitches but it's bound to happen when a game is as big as this is so I can forgive that as well. The 3 C's: It's the problems with Controls, Camera and Combat. The controls are at many time sluggish and sometimes even completely unresponsive. Why this is probably has to do with Geralt doing an animation when you push a button and that animation takes longer than you'd like. Outside of combat that's fine but when in combat that is not OK at all. Most of the time Geralt will do whatever you want to do fast but suddenly he will delay beyond belief without the enemy hindeirng him at all and sometimes he'll not even swing his sword when you push the attack button repeatedly. Other times Geralt will be stuck blocking with his sword when you're not even holding down the button, hindering you from attacking. This is rage-inducing when you're in combat because it's not your fault, something's wrong with the game. Sometimes when I've loaded a save Geralt is stuck walking in a direction without me pusing any button. I have to hold the opposite directional button, press shift+TAB and then exit out of there to correct it. That's ♥♥♥♥ing unreal. As for the camera, it's mainly a pain in the ♥♥♥ when you're indoors and it suddenly zooms in shoulder-view. In houses and tiny caverns this is extremely annoying. You can barely situate yourself comfortably and see what's in there. And during combat the camera might ♥♥♥♥ up if you back-up into a tree or a wall or whatever. But the biggest problem of these is probably the combat, despite it being really fun. For it to remotely be a challenge, play on higher dificulties. Otherwise the games essentially plays for itself, you only pressing attack and occasionaly blocking. But even then you'll stroll through the game no problem when you've leveled up enough, losing a bit of the game's enjoyment. Main quest: As much a the world's and universe's story is interesting the main quest isn't as much. It doesn't help either that the ending was so completely anticlimactic it shocked me yet I haven't heard anyone criticize it. Are every gamer just getting accustomed to lazy endings? Where're the big MGS-esque endnings anymore? This actually really bothers me...TRIGGER WARNING: I didn't like Gwent. Suck it up. Despite my criticism The Witcher 3 still stands as an amazing game, one of the best I've ever played. You'll do yourself a disservice by not playing it. I can see The Witcher 3 being regarded as the game of this decade when this decade is over. 9/10",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

450,Posted: August 25,9.7 hrs on record,"What a phenomenal game, and here's why. First of all it's extremely well optimized. I run my graphics settings on ultra for everything except shadows at 1440p resolution and I get a consistent 60 fps. Not many games I own can handle that surprisingly despite the fact that my build has good hardware. The graphics are extremely beautiful, plus the story is amazing and highly immersive. You'll get lost in this game and feel like you just fell down a rabbit hole of content. I love any style of RPG that just lets you loose in a living, breathing world and gives you free reign to just do what you please and play how you want to play. CD Projekt Red is one highly respectable company that genuinely cares about their fans and the quality of content they produce from their games. That's one of the many reasons why I will most definitely support them for years to come and why I've been extremely excited for Cyberpunk 2077. If you ask me personally I feel like they're one of the very few gaming companies left that actually have integrity. All in all do I recommend this game? Absolutely. Give them your money cause they more then deserve it and I'm positive you'll be happy with the purchase. Also, I've heard the DLC is well worth the money and that it could have been it's own game due to how long, and packed with content they are. So food for thought it might be worth picking up the complete edition. I did and I'm very excited to see all of what this game has to offer me. 11/10 Geralt showed me a good time.",1 person found this review helpful,Recommended

474,Posted: August 24,42.5 hrs on record,"THE MOST WONDERFUL THING IN THIS GAME ISGWENT. If you never played gwent before, just play, really. This mini-game have a game in gog. I´ve been playing gwent i real life, they sell two decks with a dlc Blood and Wine. StoryAfter the books end, the game start, but you don´t need to play the first games, or read the books before W3, though you going to lost something, like knowing characters, and some point in the story before W3. The game is focus on storyline, also is tell by books and notes you can find around the map, telling things happen before W3. All the main characters are based on the books, their appearance was change in some case, like Triss Merigold, she isn´t that pretty on the books, some names also was changed, like Jaskier is Dandelion. The characters are unique and some make you laugh. The main story is cliche, you can already know the plot, but is good anyway. The game have a lot of options and ends, but i never dare to make a worst end - if you do, you don`t have a heart, any feelings, anything, just a hole in your chest. DLCthere are two DLC`s in game, hearts of stone and blood and wine. Hearts of stone is some kind of terror, and take around 20hr to beat. The blood and wine - my favorite - is a vampire plot, with a new map, characters, armors... Kind a new game in this DLC. Secondary QuestsHas the secondary quests and the contracts of monsters. The contracts is find in note boards in villages and citys. People contract Geralt to slay monsters, duh, but almost all contracts have a plot, the´re good. The secondary quests are specific. You going to get this quests after met some character in the main story, or around the map. The plot is better, with some characters have a romance with T-I-T-S in the final. Gameplaythis can be frustrating and make you broke something. Walking or running are normal, but sometimes when you need to be more accurate you can´t, because he are fast and hard to control with accurate. While diving in the game, is the second worst thing in the game, doens´t have any accurate in closed spaces, like a drown ship - if you want to turn a little, he`ll turn all. - and while diving, will have some enemys, like drowners and sirens, just shot with the crossbow. Now the worst thing in the game: Roach - Dude, i hate that horse. That ♥♥♥♥ ALWAYS going to stuck in some invisible place. When running with the horse, sometimes he just stop run. The control is horrible and don´t have any accurate.MapIs the most HUGE things in the game, can be awsome to explore the map, cause have a lot of things to do, like destory nests, camp of bandits, treasures and hiden treasures, some kind of dungeons of mages.Armor/Setsin the universe of witcher, have school of witchers, Geralt is from the school of Wolf. And the other schools are Bear, Viper, Cat, Manticore and Griffin. Every schools is unique and have a lore behind. Every witcher school have a unique armor with improvements,silver and steel swords and a crowsbow. The sets are beautiful. Also have sets from the armies like nilfgaard, Temeria and Skellige, though they aren´t that pretty.

487,Posted: August 23,163.1 hrs on record,"Video games as a medium are a strange beast to tame. Telling a story in one takes a great deal of skill and finesse, and some foresight as to what the player might do. Witcher 3 handles all of these perfectly.You get a bit of a bonus if you've played the previous games, or have some familiarity with the books by Andrzej Sapkowski, upon which these games are based. You're treated to callbacks, references, and most importantly, the characters you encounter have a bit more emotional weight. You can absolutely play this game without prior knowledge of the series, but I have to highly recommend that you play the first two games to fully appreciate it.Beyond the story implications, this game fully realizes the occupation of Witcher. You will solve mysteries, and occasionally be required to use your intuition to sniff out the true answer. Failure to do so may cost lives. The previous two titles in this series make a valiant attempt to put you in the role of tracker, hunter, predator. Only here does CD Projekt fully realize the potential of the role, and truly flesh out the role of Geralt of Rivia as an expert monster-hunter. In an open world, you'll follow trails, prepare oils, really get into the nitty-gritty of monster-hunting at an expert level.Not to sideline the plot -- it's one of the absolute best conclusions to a trilogy I've ever seen. Your choices will absolutely shape the fate of the world. As is standard for this series, there are no right or wrong choices. Whatever you choose, you will likely get what you wish -- as well as all the consequences attendant to that choice. Sometimes, what seems the most sensible won't always be the choice you want to make. There are a lot of factors to consider, and the ending isn't just based on one factor.Beyond plot, the depths of gameplay are fantastic. A fully-customizable skill tree allows you to gear up for whatever comes your way. Side quests, contracts, and mini-games keep the experience fresh, and eventually you'll find yourself figuring out what you're hunting before Geralt does. The combat is fluid, the exploration never gets dull, and there's always something in the world to find.This game has a way of sucking you in, especially if you played and enjoyed the first two games. If you haven't, Wild Hunt is still very accessible and easy to understand, with a comprehensive glossary of lore. Either way, it's safe to say that it's one of the most enjoyable experiences I've ever had with a video game.",2 people found this review helpful,Recommended

505,Posted: August 22,55.2 hrs on record,"Played it on console. Base game, both DLC to completion more times than I remember. So trust me, I'm an expert :)First of all, The Witcher 3 is an experience to be lived. It's one of those ""before you die"" items every gamer has to have on their bucket list. And to say it is one of the most solid experiences to grace gamer kind in a decade is an understatement...... about that though. Frankly, TW3 is a casebook example of the effect that the shoddy work from developers and the abuse gamers have taken from publishers over the years has had on us gamers. The one game that comes around that looks and plays great and without any nonsense to put up with appears to us like a masterwork by comparison. TW3 isn't some outstanding phenomenon. It really is basically what anyone can reasonably expect from any good video game. A well made, professionally built, functional, entertaining experience without any bullcrap.What CDRP really excels in with TW3 is presentation and storytelling. This game stupendously gorgeous! Why anyone thinks we need a Witcher movie or tv series when the characters in TW3 are so lifelike is beyond me. Great lengths went into making the screenplay, script, set design, cinematography and characters as animated, composed, and natural as humanly possible. On a technical level, the graphics are unsurpassed. From the lighting to the animations to the texture work to the particle effects to the water effects to the foliage effects to the environmental effects to the motion capture and the facial expressions and the lip synching the fidelity and attention to detail on display here is absolutely mindblowing. Those with advanced graphics capable machines have and will cream themselves.The story is a quintessential choose-your-own adventure where your choices as Geralt really will determine the fate of individuals and entire nations, often in surprising ways. There is no schmaltzy morality meter here. Just you and the feeling in your gut when faced with the consequences of your decisions. And those consequences might play out in unexpected ways that have nothing to do with the morality of the situation. Each chapter is brimming with well wrought and fascinating characters who are often multifaceted in ways that most writers aren't generally accustomed to. This makes delving into the narrative and getting vested in the cast an absolute delight. The scenario of each chapter is meticulously crafted down to the finest details, making the drama a joy to navigate.Geralt himself is far more interesting than I initially gave him credit for (before playing Witcher 2). He gets quite a bit of expression out of his dirty harry impression and he is more than the brutal monster slaying sex fiend he comes off as.But on the gameplay side, there is really only one thing TW3 does particularly well. And that's the combat. It is slick. It is visceral. It is fun as all get out. There is a bit of imbalance going on, though. Bombs aren't powerful enough and neither is the crossbow. Signs are OP af. There are a few redundancies. There's a bomb that will set things on fire but the only benefit it has over the igni sign is range. There is a bomb that will lay down a flamable gas and then ignite when burned just for lulz. The crossbow is really only good for knocking flying enemies out of the sky but the aard sign is even better at it. Strong attacks are tremendously situational which makes fast attacks the dominant strategy. You'll begin every fight by casting quen as a matter of course because why wouldn't you put up a damage mitigating shield? And a high intensity yrden sign is too useful to ignore, especially against fast enemies that attack in groups. Parrying and counter attacking is usually only useful against human opponents provided you are facing only one (flanking enemies will still hit you - and enemies like to stick to and gang up on you so you'll rarely ever be facing only one) which makes dodging your best tactic in general. Ranged attackers will wreck your $h!t which makes them your first priority in any fight which means that you really don't have any choice but to make a bee-line for them as soon as you can, cast aard to knock them down or axii to shut them down or just igni to set them on fire. At high intensity the aard sign breaks all balance in combat. It will knock down every enemy surrounding you for entire seconds allowing you to casually walk around at your leisure and insta-kill poke them all to death one by one. Collision detection in combat is solid and Geralt's movement is fluid and responsive. Geralt dances around the battlefield with unsurpassed nimbleness and grace. Slow motion takedown flourishes are gruesome and even though I've seen the same ones a million times they never get old. However... Combat is pretty much the only thing you'll ever be doing the whole time. Sure, there's GWENT if you're into card games. The horse, sadly, controls like absolute crap making mounted combat broken to the point that it's easier just to dismount and take on even mounted foes on foot. Races are a breeze. I hate Hate HATE this bloody stupid horse I want to turn it into glue and set the glue on fire! The horse controls are so terrible, it's not even good for long distance travel. Seriously, you are better off running. You might move only slightly slower albeit with unlimited stamina but at least on foot Geralt isn't magnetically attracted to every rock, fence and tree trunk, balking at nothing, or charging down the wrong path 9/10 times. Geralt suddenly can't swing his sword for $h!t on horseback, which means you'll run circles around your target swinging and missing like a little leaguer. Your signs are disabled on horseback and you can't use bombs and the crossbow is generally useless anyway. The mounted controls are so insufferable, the game would be better off without Roach at all.Otherwise the general gist of the gameplay loop is to venture out and collect-a-thon all the points on the map to assemble gear and materials with the ultimate goal being to assemble the witcher gear sets. All of this involves combat. There really isn't much else to do. Quests play out in a linear fashion. You'll never really get a choice in how to proceed in a quest outside of story choices. Just follow directions. And the game suffers from overuse of the witcher sense mechanic for tracking monsters and investigating missing persons which is straightforward and simple and tedious and it gets old really fast. The gameplay of TW3 is generally solid, a bit unbalanced, but also woefully shallow. It can be engaging for a bit unless you are completely put off by collect-a-thons but it wears thin after a while.This pretty much leaves the outstanding narrative as TW3's defining feature. There is enough replay in the story to keep you going through multiple playthroughs provided you haven't gotten bored with the gameplay already.A note on Geralt's directional movement. It is managable but constantly fussy. Geralt has a problem tackling stairs for some reason. He sorta likes to fall down them a lot. It doesn't do much but take you out of the fantasy of being a bad ♥♥♥ monster slayer when you're tumbling down stairs all the time. Geralt also can't turn in place, which makes precision placement such as for opening specific loot containers or even finding a door knob a challenge. This is an even bigger problem underwater since his turn radius is even greater. Geralt's forward movement also accelerates harshly but he also takes several additional steps forward after laying off the control. This makes him move forward in spastic fits and stops making our bad ♥♥♥ monster slayer look like a flailing idiot. I especially love it when he's attempting to turn around and takes the corner of a raised surface, twists and then tumbles off it like a tard. The directional controls are much better since launch but there is still a constant struggle against them.",2 people found this review helpful,Recommended

533,Posted: August 21,130.2 hrs on record,"Genre: RPG/Open World/Story-drivenThis is one of those extremly rare games that make you ask yourself, will I be able to enjoy other games same from now on. It's one of the best games I've ever played, my top 5. It's really incredible journey.World is really big and really beautiful, especially Blood and Wine world, which is probably the most beautiful world I've seen in games. Riding with your horse through this world, while listening to epic music is really fun. However when you get bored of riding, you can always use one of many fast travel points. There are few big cities in this game, and a lot of villages. There are too many side quests to do, you can find them on notice boards all over the world, or accept contracts from random people that you meet. I personally dislike doing those tasks, because they don't have any connection to the story, and also this game is too easy, so no need to grind. However side quests that you get from main characters while playing main story can be really interesting, and I completed all of them. Additional stuff I should mention: you can use boats to travel, you can play Gwent(some card game that everyone plays in this world, but I am just not into this stuff), you can swim in water, and even underwater. Game has options to play Hearts of Stone or Blood and Wine directly without having to beat the main game, so that's a nice thing. There is also option to play ng+. Here are some screenshots of the world: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1800996585https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1839668916Now on some other stuff. Geralt uses 2 swords, one for humans, and one for monsters(silver sword). Since this is RPG, you can of course change weapons and armor regularly. You can craft armor, weapons, find them around the world, or just buy them, choice is yours. Geralt as every other witcher uses potions when needed, which boost your attack strength, heal you etc. To prepare those potions you need to first find formuls for them, and  of course ingredients. While leveling up you get skill points that you can invest into weapons, signs, potions or general stuff, like inventory etc. In Blood and Wine you also get ability to unlock advanced mutations. Gameplay itself is really easy even on the hardest difficulty, this is mostly cause Geralt has ability to use sign Quen which is protective shield which lets you take hit without damage, and you can spam this shield every 6,7 seconds, however shield won't regenerate if you are jumping around, but if you dodge around it will. And it's incredible how you can dodge pretty much everything here, just press dodge whenever you want and it will dodge through opponents attacks. So gameplay itself is average, and really easy. It's fun I guess, but animations just feel outdated, and it's really easy.Story of the main game is pretty good, but not quite amazing. Emperor of Nilfgaardian Empire has commanded you to find his daughter Ciri which is exactly what you are doing, and 80% of game 's story can be explained as: ""Oh you wish to know where Ciri is? First do something for me and then I will point you out in right direction."" And this is fine I guess, informations can cost a lot sometimes. You have been told that Ciri has been seen in 3 places: Velen, Novigrad and Skelige. Velen's story is pretty good, Novigrad's missions are mostly boring and tiring, and Skelige was good to me. After that it's just epic till the end. There are important choices that you can make in this game, however effects of these choices are not the most obvious. As for Hearts of Stone DLC, this DLC has a bit boring quests, but story is just amazing. It has better boss fights than the main game, really emotional story, definitelly one of the best stories I've ever heard, and it's featuring really cool characters. DLC itself is short, but it doesn't have many cons. Blood and Wine dlc is extremly good, writting is superb, story is also pretty good, not as good as first dlc's story, but this DLC overall is definitelly best part of the game. World is just wonderful, feels like some world straight out of fairy tale, as Geralt uses to say. Boss fight at the end is amazing, however this boss fight is optional, I chose not to fight this guy, cause I didn't feel like I should fight him. Pros:- Incredible journey- Pretty good main story- Superb writting- Geralt is such a badass - World is just too beautiful, especially Blood and Wine, the most beautiful world I've seen in games- Hearts of Stone has really amazing and sad story, and Blood and Wine is best part of the game, with pretty good storyNeutral:- Gameplay is not the best, but still good enough- Hearts of Stone has some quests that are boring, but it all fits well at the end- Choices have hidden meanings. Choices in DLCs are way more obvious, there aren't many of them, but they are betterCons:- It's really easy game thanks to sign Quen- Novigrad missions are mostly boring- Final bossfight of the main game is lame, boss can barely hurt you, and you have to hit him like 100 times- Ending is not completelly clearVerdict: Incredible journey overall, one of the best games I've ever played, my top 5, close to masterpiece. This game really made me experience the life of the witcher.

535,Posted: August 21,88.7 hrs on record,I don't review much game. But this one is a deeply literal work. Didn't think CDPR could top their work with previous games. I was gladly wrong. All the character have their emotions and facial expressions even more. Of course no need to say that mechanics doesn't bother you so you can get in the game within peace.Things went wrong with this game are the useless main story and the fact that it is indeed short. And the reason people actually thing it's not is because the main story will lead you to side missions that will lead you to different stories which will shake your world.So a con became a pro. This is what makes me love this game.,No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

545,Posted: August 20,97.8 hrs on record,"Most deserved of all the recognition and awards. From my point of view with many years of RPG gaming, this is the penultimate experience with many refined systems open to the player's own ingenuity. 4 years after it's release this game feels like it might be giving some ground up in the visual department to next generation visuals. But may very well be the best game ever made - considering the production value, deep lore, massive open world, and amount of content. This is crafted like no game before. The difficulty can be set to like Saturday Morning Cartoon for adults and everything in between to basically blindfolded without the HUD.  The Witcher 3 experience tells the player a story as it progresses, note that it is nice to take a break and let someone else play to watch and rest, it is an epic. The Witcher 3 was created in mind with innovations only dreamed about technologically years ago, ala Elder Scrolls, huge open world and realistic environments and also tugs at all the appropriate RPG cliches, but I am surprised at the exclusion of any stealth mechanics. 70+ hours in and seen the most amazing stuff just recently as the player can never surpass the story in their exploits of leveling , but is odd to watch or be thrown into scenarios with much lower level content, such as low rewards and enemies. Plus, I can't imagine so many dead bodies had the expressed time to write their own eulogies and directions to their hidden booty, but in the world of the Witcher it seems to happen very prevalent.The Immense open world is astonishingly detailed although repetitive, the player will experience environments of a dichotomy of not only nature also extremities of emotional atmosphere. I seem to be stuck in a stun from the deliberate exercise of graphical virtuosity after countless beautiful scenes of absolute gorgeous landscapes in every conceivable direction. There is nothing comparable to the Witcher 3 past or presently that can invoke such an array of feelings through its precision of intertwining story and visuals. Story telling like this is prudent in it's delivery that holds very little back. In the vein of very shocking to the most sentimental of moments. Fans of voice acting can rejoice as there is a plethora and even Geralt has become a bit more candid due to being the main player character and the inordinate time spent as him to be likable. Not for the faint of heart, you will be the direct target of many an insult and vulgarity while running through towns.It plays like this: Navigation, exploring, investigation! So much loot, just too much and that is forgiven as it is in  reciprocal of the title's grand scale. Game has got over 400 quests, many which are multi faceted driven by player choice, along with mini-games and treasure hunts. The gameplay and the way Geralt controls is slippery as it should, expressing momentum and great fun in combat as the player mixes things up with magic signs and swordplay with the element of strategy in the form of buffs/potions and oils. I feel the combat is very much like a dance and beautiful to watch, that keeps the fighting from getting stale.They have been very generous with the sound profile and the effects are top tier and the music is great. Outlandish, tribal with an assortment of instruments, I have never heard before. Every single quest has its own uniqueness about it per environment, noticeable by voice filtering and ambient noises.In finale, Yes! it does get overwhelming, and not all quests are very much in contrast to others, and things do feel like filler. After many hours into it just like anything, I wanted the game to end. I had gotten sick of getting snagged onto the environment or running into people on crowded streets. More and more packs of monsters that I had killed their kind of in so many numbers, still roamed the countryside. But here is when I progressed the story missions and found absolution and resolve to keep on playing. Base building would have been nice but that like some other minor things have been omitted due to story-lore. It is games like this and Skyrim that have us sitting on our asses for hour upon hour playing swords and magic, waiting to learn that one spell that will give us all our time back.Then I realized, this game deserves to be played, everything is of such good quality that no other game is a better time sink. The only thing better than playing Witcher 3 is in all likelihood, something other than playing a game.",2 people found this review helpful,Recommended

579,Posted: August 19,164.5 hrs on record,"The Witcher 3 makes what should have been a terrifying risk look like the most natural evolution in the world.The Witcher and its sequel established a fascinating fantasy world full of politics, intrigue, magic and monsters, and rooted it all in Geralt of Rivia, one of the last of the infamous Witchers — bounty hunters created through a potentially fatal series of trials and alchemical mutations, for hire by anyone with coin to destroy monsters. The Witcher 2 placed this within an action adventure context largely linear in structure, albeit with major plot changes and entirely different second halves based on player decisions made early on.The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt takes the setting and complicated world-building of its predecessor and blows them out with an ambitious but logical next-step: an open-world game. For a studio without the AAA resources of a Bethesda or EA, transitioning from a more conservative linear structure to an undertaking so massive demonstrates a level of confidence bordering on insanity.Geralt’s task is immediately complicated by several factors: 1) That Ciri possesses some immense but little-understood cosmic power; 2) that for reasons unknown, Ciri is being pursued by an unstoppable interdimensional attack squad known as The Wild Hunt; 3) that the sorceress the emperor has enlisted to aid Geralt in his quest is Geralt’s own lost love Yennefer; and most of all 4) that Geralt raised and trained Ciri himself, and thinks of her as his own adopted daughter.Wild Hunt’s geographical size is impressive on its own—this game is much larger than previous bragging-rights-holders like Skyrim and Grand Theft Auto V, and it feels it. That immense size doesn’t just exist for its own sake; it serves an important function in the game’s overall design and effect. Wild Hunt conjures the illusion of an actual kingdom full of actual villages populated by actual people, and through sheer size effectively conveys the feeling of wandering an endless wilderness.Geralt has a variety of offensive and defensive abilities aside from his swords. He can cast signs, a low-grade kind of Witcher magic that lets him blast gusts of air or fire at foes, conjure a protective shield around himself, or crawl inside the minds of his human opponents and leave them defenseless. Geralt can also craft any of a number of explosive bombs and is equipped with a nifty crossbow that comes in mighty handy when taking on flocks of airborne beasts.Understanding one’s enemies is important, which makes the preliminary, detective-like investigation of each individual monster more than just a roadblock between you and the inevitable showdown. It’s crucial that Geralt understand what he’s going up against in advance, so that he can brew the appropriate potions, equip the appropriate weapons, and apply the appropriate oils to his blade. You can’t change Geralt’s loadout in the middle of combat, a smart restriction that forces players to think like a Witcher and take their enemy’s strengths and weaknesses into account ahead of time.Wild Hunt is a grand adventure that feels distinctly of its time. It manages to set new standards for video game technology while accentuating the fleeting nature of technological achievement as an end unto itself. It is a worthy exploration of friendship and family, mixing scenes of great sorrow with scenes of ridiculous lustiness, tempering its melancholy with bright splashes of joy and merry monster guts. Come for the epic showdown between good and evil; stay for the unicorn sex.",3 people found this review helpful,Recommended
580,Posted: August 19,322.0 hrs on record,"After 300+ hours of gameplay, having completed absolutely every single quest there is in the game (I used a checklist for that) and completing all achievements, I think I have the right to express my opinion. The game is objectively bad – it sure has some pros, but they are definitely outnumbered by the cons.  Now hear me out with the pros first! - Some very good quests with an in-depth writing, interesting characters and plot twists. Example: The Bloody Baron questline, that’s probably the best thing in the whole game – the detective work you have to do is implemented flawlessly, the characters are interesting, have good background stories and the tasks connected to them seem purposeful and are actually quite fun.- Great variety of creatures and monsters! Do you know how tired I am of games whose mobs are made like this: Goblin, Goblin berserker, Goblin assassin, Goblin warchief, Goblin fighter, Goblin archer, etc. etc. etc. In the Witcher 3 there is everything – gruesome zombie-like monsters, ghosts, spirits, witches, mythical creatures, animals and even some innovative races/creatures that you have never seen before in any other game or even movie or a book.- Good lore (Mind that I say lore, not storyline)- Great optimization. I run it at 1440p/100fps on max settings and it feels fantastic! Some neutral stuff: - Graphics. They are nice, but they look like any other AAA game made in 2015, so I don’t see the big deal.- Scenery is alright, although it’s the same forest for 75% of the game and then some tundra.- Loading times are not so bad.- The witcher sense is a better way of leading the player to the objective instead of an ordinary quest marker.- Gwent – it can be quite fun at times, but most of the time it’s a boring chore. Now, let’s look at the cons: - Tremendously boring combat – it revolves around mashing your left mouse button and occasionally dodging an enemy attack or two. It’s so easy even on the highest difficulty that the combat feels like a chore. The final bosses are the same – the mechanics consist of dodging boring attacks and maybe some spell but that’s it. Even the combat in The Witcher 1 is more enjoyable. The spinning sword attack in fun, though.- Roleplaying? Are you kidding me??? If you call having two available endings to one quest roleplaying, then don’t even try to talk to me. See, you can’t really roleplay in The Witcher 3 – For the most time you have just 2 endings of one quest and they don’t even matter at all! They alter almost nothing in the world and don’t contribute to the ending of the final quest. As of class roleplaying – the only available one is a swordsmaster. There are like five other weapons in the game other than swords and they are weak as heck, so you can’t really use axes or maces, for example. The potions and spells are useless, once you get the hang of the combat (which takes about 40 minutes), so you can’t be a mage or a potionmaster. You can’t be an archer – the crossbow is useless for actual combat and there is no stealth. Sure, you can roleplay as a good guy or a scumbag every once in a while, but that’s just a slight, tiny roleplaying component that does not create a full roleplaying experience by any means!- Every single character is staggeringly obnoxious and the voice acting is stupidly cringeworthy. Ciri seemed nice at first, but then I realized she’s “the chosen one”, “the one of possession of great, unknown power” – what a cliché... And the godlings – they are nice at least, but their type of fun sucks.- Items – 90% of the armors make you look like an ♥♥♥. All of the swords are the same, the sets are boring, nothing feels unique.- The quests are generally very mundane, they usually go like this: “Oy, Witcha’! Can ye help me find me lass? She’s been lost all week! Please, I beg ye, I got some coin, masta’ witcha’!” And then you use your witcher sense to track something down, find a monster and that’s it.- The story is very simple, boring and clichéd. You need to find someone, you have some difficulties in doing so, then you find that someone and everything is back to normal, woho!- Stupid, meaningless dialogues.- Herbalism aspect – there is nothing where you can read up where the herbs you need to get are located, so you just collect everything you find in hope you get what you need. That leaves you with bags full of crap for the rest of the game.- Mini-tasks: Horse races – kek, brawls – kek (although the last two combatants are funny).I am sorry to all the hardcore fans, but that’s really how I feel. I might update the review in the future!",5 people found this review helpful2 people found this review funny,Not Recommended

590,Posted: August 18,148.9 hrs on record,"For sure this is an amazing game, and since everyone has written everywhere how amazing it is I'll just note a few areas I really didn't feel it lived up to the hype.  Having played Witcher 1 and 2 in preparation for this, I found 2 has a way better main story, and better decisions affecting outcomes.  Complex politics is just way way more interesting than spending ages finding a girl, or finding the people who last saw the girl, or even finding the people who last saw the person who saw the girl. There is finally a showdown with the head bad guy who is never really developed or the motives.  The main story here is a very generic boring story and is huge let down. The bad guy is bad cos he's bad. Also the endings which result in whether a main character dies or not is based on a few conversation choices which at the time give no weight to how important those conversation choices were.  I read back in the guides and It seems like a joke that they are what determines death.  Also the main story is framed as an urgent chase, and yet of course the best of the game is all the side quests mixed in.  It doesn't fit the suspension of disbelief at all having the main story everything urgent and then breaking off for some side quests.  Also I found many of the quests way too reliant on the Witcher sense.  It got tedious after a while the same quest formula over and over.  Felt like lazy writing.  The voice acting is superb, but I think there was way too much dialog and cut scenes.I have had a great time playing it and the world you get to play in looks jaw dropping @4k Ultra.  It is super polished and I think one of the best games ever made visually and the music  and sound effects are brilliant.  It just didn't live up to the previous outings in main story.",1 person found this review helpful,Recommended

599,Posted: August 18,124.1 hrs on record,"An absolute masterpiece. If you haven't played this, your life isn't whole. Trust me, you'll find yourself dying to find out what happens next in the story. The side quests aren't boring and repetitive, and your actions in them actually feed into the main story and the state of the game world. Even the Witcher contracts, which are the closest thing to repetitive are fun and rewarding. The crafting system is less hands-on than Skyrim but by all rights is more in-depth in terms of armor and weapon creation. Searching everything doesn't just yield things worthy of selling, but crafting and alchemy diagrams. The skill tree leaves a little to be desired for but honestly keeps you from becoming too overpowered. You're limited to 12 perks and 4 mutagens (basically stat buffs) that feed off these perks. There are mods to expand these but I warn you, you may become too powerful for the game to be fun. The combat system is difficult enough but once you map your controls well you'll become nearly untouchable. The Gwent minigame is fun and strategic, with hundreds of cards to collect via winning card games. To top it all off, buy the DLC's. I hate to sound like a salesman, but the DLC's almost double the amount of time you'll spend on the game.To conclude: 12/10",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

609,Posted: August 18,113.5 hrs on record,"This is my very first review of the game on Steam. I'm not a writer but I feel like I have to do this just for this game.First of all I must say that I'm a huge fan of Andrzej Sapkowski's books (not only The Witcher series) I've read all of them. So I look at The Witcher games from different perspective. CD Projekt Red done amazing job of keeping this game story (aswell as first two in the series) so close and true to the books. I absolutely love the main story line which starts in short stories and then continues into five volumes of the main novel. And then we have this fantastic continuetion through games, Witcher 1 and 2 and finally The Witcher 3 which is a pinnacle of this amazing story. If you didn't read Sapkowski's books then make yourself a favour and read them, starting from short stories volume 1: ""Last Wish"". And trust me if you read them all and then go back to the games you will experience them from a different, much deeper and emotional perspective.I'm not going to talk about graphics nor sound because it's pointless. So go grab those books and after that play those games again ;)",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

637,Posted: August 16,10.2 hrs on record,"I was extremely hyped to get this game, but came out disappointed.The fixed third person camera killed the game to me. Also, I hate how there's a total lack of basic tutorials that explain the most important things, like repairing the sword or how to get great gear, levels and upgrades to weapons in a way that you can compete with most bosses on the game without lowering the difficulty. At least on Skyrim, we could change beetween cameras and despite the ugly graphics, textures, face models and recycled voice actors, the setting, the main story, gameplay and the soundtrack was so much better. It felt much more awarding and worth it. I would personally spend a lot more on Skyrim content if they released new content by now. And the mods, don't forget about them.What a waste of my precious 15€.I won't suggest Skyrim instead, as most gamers already tried it by now, but if you cherish your money so much, I would recommend you to go play Kingdom Come: Deliverance. You'll spend a lot more but at least you won't feel wallet ♥♥♥♥♥ like with the Witcher 3. Or go and play the old Dragon Age Origins.

651,Posted: August 16,32.0 hrs on record,"I would recommend The Witcher 3 to a specific audience. Those who enjoy story, character development and sitting back to enjoy a semi-movie, this game would suit you.The Witcher 3 is a massive time sink. It builds up slowly to an unknown climax, by means of fed-ex quests, brief hack and slash moments and mini-games. It's huge in scale and dense in content, but it doesn't nail every bit completely.For example, though the game is narrative driven, the audio isn't finely tuned, character voices are badly cast, and characters with a small role reuse the same model a lot.The combat is inspired by the Arkham series, but doesn't have the same effect as you would think. Spamming the armor spell and mashing the attack button will get you far and the enemies hardly challenge you to try something else.The environment is huge and well crafted, but after playing for some hours you notice how empty it truly is. This is mainly evident during quests where you chase dialogue after dialogue, and have to rush between them on your horse.I could name plenty of things that are off. But what they did get right is the subtitle of the game, ""Wild Hunt"". The game shines in it's world building, with monsters and magic. The game gives you a comfortable feeling in any situation. Be it in a field where the wind is blowing and pulling at the trees, or in a crowded tavern with warm colors. Hunting large monsters is by far the best experience, where you first investigate by gathering clues to answer the what, where and how's. Then you prepare for the fight, visit shops, craft potions and plan what tactics to apply. Finally you confront the beast and slay it, followed by rewards and new items to develop yourself for future encounters.A quality game, riddled with content, a little bland from time to time, great for story, but not for me.",4 people found this review helpful,Recommended

664,Posted: August 15,37.0 hrs on record,"Overrated garbage. I played this first time when it came out and wasn't impressed. Now I gave it a second or third shot and I'm even less impressed. Play in this semi-realistic yet unrelatable dull fantasy world as detective Geralt, CSI hero and errand boy -- what could be better? Well how about anything else.Gameplay consists of carefully looking the world through minimap, tedious fighting that works out same every time, tedious errand labor, listening to mentally handicapped sherlock holmes piece together a scene. Most of the time you are gathering piles and piles of garbage from enemies, and from houses which are surprisingly profitable even though they belong to peasants -- and they must be really rich peasants too since they don't mind if you take all their stuff. So you do all this because then you can buy bigger bags to put on your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ horse so you can collect even more garbage. And it turns out you don't even need that, you don't need anything! Where's the Fight Club in this world?Tedious, repetitive, unrewarding. Go from A to B and from there to C and then back to B and A, so you get something that isn't worth anything so you can do more of the same that you just did. What's the point? I really don't understand all the high praise. It has more mature tone and the sarcasm is quite brilliant at times but that's like maybe 1% of the game. Never coming back to this again, good riddance.Edit: After uninstalling the game and sleeping like a baby after that, I now realized what my main problem is with the game. There is no real freedom despite the open world. I feel like I'm playing nothing but tutorial, constantly being kept on a leash and wondering when it really begins. Choices I have pretty much are simple do or don't do, and I got to mainly do since there's no real alternative and I have to get experience that the enemies don't give. I have zero incentive to play this since it requires me only to be a good boy and behave. The game as elder sits me down and hands me ice cream as distraction to keep me put, while it tells me tales I wouldn't listen if I weren't forced to. After that it says ""Now go out and play at the area we agreed on, and obey the rules I told you. Be sure to be back in 5 minutes though, we'll have dinner soon.""",6 people found this review helpful3 people found this review funny,Not Recommended

674,Posted: August 15,131.5 hrs on record,"The Witcher速 3: Wild Hunt ReviewThe Witcher速 3: Wild Hunt is a pleasure to play, the world is vast, it's compelling, and dangerous. The characters are compelling, and feel real. CD PROJEKT RED has out done themselves, from humble beginnings with The Witcher in 2008, they have certainly come a long way, and traveling that way along the Path with Geralt is an adventure like no other.Out of this world storytelling, impressive swashbuckling swordplay and magic at your fingertips, Geralt slays monsters, human and beast alike. You truly get the sense of the life on the Path like no other, even more so than the original books by Andrzej Sapkowski in my humble opinion. In previous Witcher games, something was always lacking. perhaps it was the lack of meaningful choice. Perhaps it was a lack of freedom. In any case, The Witcher 3 cures that emptiness, and allows you to make all the choices you want, and go almost anywhere you want. Be warned though, as some areas and enemies are simply impossible to explore/slay early game. Luckily, the mechanics make it obvious when this is the case, and when you come back a higher level, you recall when you were unable to progress in that area, and you feel more powerful and accomplished because of it. Like all games, however, it does have its issues. Mainly in the area of stability. The constant, sometimes back to back crashing can ruin the experience. There are things you can do to prevent this, but the problem never goes away. That being said, SAVE LIBERALLY. Because the world is truly open, there is a disturbing lack of autosaves, so don't be shy with that F5 key.Concept Ratings (out of 10)Graphics - 9Music - 10Animation - 7Story - 10Content - 10Controls - 8Gameplay - 9ConclusionWithout a shadow of a doubt, The Witcher速 3: Wild Hunt is one of the greatest role-playing games of all time. My biggest gripe is that my save game from The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings didn't seem to role over to The Witcher速 3: Wild Hunt. If someone could help me with that I'd be very grateful, as I miss some characters from that game that would have appeared if my data had transferred over correctly.9/10 - A near perfect game and absolutely worth it at full price.",1 person found this review helpful,Recommended

679,Posted: August 15,179.7 hrs on record,"Amazing and beautiful game, based on a series of books by Andrzej Sapkowski.  Brilliant story and characters,with a sprinkle of humour here and there. Quest driven single player game, open world full of interesting places to explore either on foot or horse. The medieval themed towns and cities are unbelievably full of detail. There is so much to do from main quests, sub-plots, contracts to slay monsters, horse races, treasure hunts and a good levelling system. The choices you make during the quests actually effect the outcome of the game. You can play Geralt as a cold hearted womaniser if you wish, but you can also play him as someone who will do almost anything for his friends and stays faithful to his one true love Yennefer. You also have to decide how to react and what to do on quests involving Ciri, a young Witcher who is like a daughter to him.

It is like playing an interactive film (a really long film, imagine the Lord of the Rings Trilogy extended edition x2) The only thing that could degrade the reputation this game has built is if the Netflix series is rubbish. Only time will tell.Final words, buy this game and then come up with at least 20 excuses why you won't be making any of the plans you have for the next 2 weeks.",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

I rarely get particularly animated during my time when I play games, but this game stoked a reaction I had never experienced before. I was playing and really into, and enjoying the game, when I handed a quest in and was left pretty stunned. And? Well the thing is I found myself literally giving the voice acting in the game a rapturous round of applause upon handing in a quest! Like a full on, hands off keyboard and mouse standing ovation, purely for the handing in of a quest. That alone should tell you the essence of this game, the voice acting and story alone deserves all it's fanfare!Without doubt, the defining gaming experience of it's generation.

749,Posted: August 12,56.0 hrs on record,"Some gripes with the game :  The control scheme for the game is a bit confusing, it seems to me that the controls were designed with consoles in mind (personal opinion). The falling damage in the game can be frustrating. The combat does feel a bit to simple and enemy targeting can be ""hit or miss"" from time to time. Finally, to a casual player the game might be overwhelming at first. Great points about the game :   The gameplay is excellent and the game mechanics feel very rewarding. The visuals are breathtaking, you will easily spend hours just looking at the world. The NPC have dialogue options which might even make you not skip conversations. The DLC for the game add a lot for not that much really, ""Blood and Wine"" especially. Did get the game on sale, but it is WORTH the full asking price without a doubt.

The main story arc was fantastic, I'll refrain from spoiling anything... but sometimes, the right thing to do isn't always clear - your choices have some real heavy repercussions. There's an in-game mini-card-game called Gwent which I thoroughly enjoyed and found myself spending more time playing than the actual game.

While anyone, including myself, will likely find something they're not fond of gameplay wise, it is utterly undeniable that CD Projekt Red has put incredible effort into balancing how you progress through the game. The story is without a doubt the greatest part of this game. Different storylines are resolved by different choices you make throughout the game, and all of these endings affect the full ending of the game. And the dlc is the same way. Speaking of the dlc, both major expansions can be considered whole games by themselves, to the point that you can access a mode when starting a new game that lets you just play either expansion.The only major issue is that this game can be somewhat of a chore after one or two playthroughs, but no game is immune to this, so it's not as bad as it sounds.

805,Posted: August 10,105.8 hrs on record,"I'm sorry, of course, but it's been so long and it's time to open your eyes to the truth. Hyip from the Witcher has already passed and you can soberly look at things. I've been trying to figure out for three years why everyone praises the Witcher so much. For me personally, he is head and shoulders below even the same of Skyrim. In the Witcher except for the beautiful nature and worked on quests (partly. The main story is only good in the first half of the game and all side effects should essentially do the same thing — running on the trail using instinct) there is nothing at all. Gameplay the game is nothing. Absolutely deserted world, in which there is nothing to do but a dull grind of all the same villages and robber camps, which again makes no sense, as a reward you get absolutely useless stuff like a coil of wire or a handful of nails, which can only be sold for 5 cents. It is obvious that people did not even really try and just stupidly tried to ""wind the timing"" of game time, filling up the desert world with useless debris of the same type.The combat system is so poor and simple (not to mention that 90% of the abilok just useless) that I had a strong feeling that I was trying to get wet face in A. not Only that, to complete the game you just had to zaklikivat enemy (not even dodging at the same time, because you can just smear Kven and not strain the extra finger), so they still give you an abilka, so you can just hold down one button, close your eyes and quietly wait until Geralt does everything himself. And it's all at maximum complexity, of course. I can't even imagine what it's like to play on a lower difficulty. You must be accompanied by a group of vassals, clearing the way for you from any fall, or something like that. After two parts of the DS to play such a gameplay misunderstanding was for me a real torture. Many criticize Skyrim for casualness, but the Witcher surpassed all possible limits. So oxazolines interactive kintz from the world of RPG, I haven't seen.Duck would be okay, was a fascinating story, but this is also a problem. Really interesting was the only quest line of the bloody Baron. Perhaps the most elaborate part of the game. But then everything went on rolled and rolled into an absolute banality.In short, for me personally the Witcher 3 was the main failure of the last years. So hyped professional with ignorami and tachypnoe in community dummy I've never seen before.He played it for about 400 hours and the opinion was the most complete. Why did you suffer so much, you ask? Well, just so I have a principled approach. If you started to play something, then by all means drink from the game all the juices and explore every nook and cranny, even if you do not like. Especially because in the Wake of such a hyip in the heart until the very end glimmered hope: what if it just seems at first glance, suddenly it's just a bad piece of the game and over that turn will begin the real gameplay... But no. The miracle did not happen. In fact, in the first 10-20 hours of gameplay you can see absolutely everything on offer for the Witcher. I can not even imagine what a masochist you need to be to pass the game more than once. Although I personally know these guys.Thank you for your attention. I'm done.",17 people found this review helpful4 people found this review funny,Not Recommended

835,Posted: August 8,60.0 hrs on record,"What is so unique about this game is that it is not afraid to showcase what it wants to. It does not sugarcoat anything. It makes you laugh, sad, and sometimes even terrified of what might happen. In short this game is a masterpiece. Although my review probably does not matter as this game is so well known, I would like to write some praises so future generations may see it and still decide to play this game.  Graphics  The scenery in this game are truly breathtaking at times. Sometimes you feel like you are in a fairytale, surrounded by flowers, animals, beasts, castles, mountains, lakes, and villages. My two favourite regions are skellige and Toussaint (blood and wine dlc). Also, the characters look amazing when you put settings to ultra. All in all, the graphics will make you remember the game for years to come.  Soundtrack/Voice Acting  The soundtrack definitely helps make the game into a masterpiece in my opinion. It matches with the situation and region. When you are in majestic places such as skellige, the music is epic. When you are in a war ravaged or dangerous area, the music is dark and scary. It really makes you feel immersed in the game and the environment. The voice acting is fine in this game as well. Geralt, yen, and Regis (blood and wine dlc) is definitely the most well done. Some characters may not be the best, but it is still better than average. So no complaints there.   Gameplay  The game interface is well designed. The menus are easy to understand and access. The game is broken into different regions throughout the Witcher 3 world. Most times, you would finish the quests in one region before moving on to another region. Although you can travel in between regions if you wish. The quests are interesting and unique. Each one has something different, such as new characters, tasks, monsters, and rewards. They really make you see the creativity of the developers. The combat is decent as well, no trouble accessing potions or casting signs or dodging attacks. What I love about the game is that it gives you the choice to take your time to explore. You are not forced to finish the main quests in a time frame. The amount of content in this game is crazy. It will take at least 100 hours for you to do every single quest.  Story  The story is also very interesting as it is just the right pace for plot development. It gives you the right amount of background for you to feel close to the main characters, but not too much as to annoy you. The quests also tie into the main story quite well. I also love how sometimes you suddenly meet someone or get a new quest that is related to something you did a while ago. The story is written to perfection in my opinion.  Final thoughts  I have to give this game a 10/10 because although it is not perfect, it is the most deserving when compared to other recent RPGs. Thanks to the developers for this amazing game. Please buy this game, especially on sale. Best purchase you will ever make.",1 person found this review helpful,Recommended

837,Posted: August 8,452.4 hrs on record,"The game has awesome stories, that split off into different ending, choices you make actually make a difference. And this are not obvious choices, it's not like choosing between good and bad. Sometime both options are bad Other times doing something good may lead to something bad, and you have to decided to. There are risk and rewards, and risks are real. Or at least feel real, I haven't tried reloading and trying different options. I would say this is the best quality of this game.Most of the time game holds you hand to solve quests, just follow the steps. Very few quests require actual thinking.Graphics and atmosphere are pretty awesome, but playing in 3rd person the atmosphere doesn't make as much of an impact as it could from 1st person. The game does not feel immersive, mostly feels like watching a movie with all the cut-scenes too.Controls feel very disconnected often annoying, Sometime the Gerald swing his weapon in the direction the camera is facing and other times he swings his sword in the direction he is facing. You dodge enemy's attack, time it right to get behind the enemy and start swing the sword in the direction where there are no enemies. Some time he just plain refuses to do a strong attack, you hold shift and click the mouse and he just does nothing. I was confused sometime I thought maybe it's a game mechanic and I need wait for adrenaline to build up or something... later I found out it's just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls. Trying to pick up sh!t is also pretty annoying. Controls and how the game feels is probably the worst quality of this game.Battle are alright, sometimes you feel like a boss by combined ability and doing different moves, other times feel annoyed because staggering fast attacks is more effective than anything else.Character progression is pretty lame if you compare it to an RPGs, but I guess this isn't a typical RPG. You don't get to build you character like you want, because your character is already pre-build. I actually played most of the game with a Axe or Hammer as a secondary weapon, just to be different. There isn't much difference between Light Armour and Heavy Armour.Replay-ability probably high, since you can branch your quests in a different way and get different ending which is really cool. But for myself I don't think I'll ever play this game again, as I do with other RPGs. But I would play next Witcher game :)",No one has rated this review as helpful yet1 person found this review funny,Not Recommended

There's tons of armor and weapons I didn't use much, once I acquired witcher gear I tended to use it almost exclusively. Cutscenes and dialogue drive the main story, and though they can be skipped through they feel a bit long on replay.Pros: Tons of various side-missions and exploration keeps you from feeling locked into a linear story, and some of the sidequests have endgame consequences not apparent at the time. The main story is fantastic, and more immersive than Skyrim and some of the Fallout games. By far my favorite pick on Steam.",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

857,Posted: August 8,42.1 hrs on record,"Synopsis:The Witcher 3 is a Action-Roleplaying Game based on the Witcher Series Fantasy Novels. The Game is played in an Open World with a 3rd-Person Perspective. You play as Geralt of Rivia, a Monster Hunter known as a Witcher who is looking for his adopted daughter Ciri (he adopted with Yennefer) who is on the run from the Wild Hunt. Geralt is aided by his lover Yennefer a powerful Sorceress, his former lover Triss a Sorceress as well, the Bard Dandelion, the Dwarf Warrior Zoltan, and Geralt's Mentor Vesemir. You can also fast travel with Roach (Geralt's Horse), and even fight on top of the Horse. The Witcher 3 has several Endings (36+) which are determined by the choices you make within the Game. You can battle with Weapons - two Swords: one Steel and one Silver and Magic, interact with people around you, complete the Main Quest, and Side Quests for Gold and XP - both of which are used to strengthen Geralt's Abilities and to purchase equipment.The Continent that the Game takes place on is surrounded by parallel dimensions, and extra dimensional worlds. Humans, Elves, Dwarves, Monsters, and other Creatures co-exist there together but non humans are very often persecuted by Humans. The Continent is caught up in a war between the Empire of Nilfgaard led by Emperor Emhyr var Emreis, and Redania ruled by King Radovid V. PS. The Choices made in the Witcher 1 and 2 can carry over into the Witcher 3. Comments:I just recently got into the Witcher Games, so far I am really digging this Game but that's no surprise since RPG's is my fave genre along with Survival Games. The Graphics are really amazing / beautiful in this Game, they remind me of Skyrim but even better. I love how realistic the Scenes are, and the voice acting is pretty good, and Geralt... ooo Geralt <3. Another thing I really like is how lively the towns in the Game are, there are always people seeming to run about, it actually looks like they are truly living and working there. But yea if you are into RPG Games with AMAZING Graphics, nice voice acting, realistic fights (not just hacking and slashing but actual blocking etc.), a lively world, and an expansive story-line to get lost in, a Game where choices matter and actions have consequences, then you are going to love the Witcher Series!PS.

CD Project has created a masterwork beyond words. I felt maybe every bit of emotion a human can feel in this game. The Graphics look in the year 2019 still stunning and beautiful, the quests are absolute fantastic written pieces and like 90% of all ""side missions"" have better stories to tell than some other AAA Games. I will give this game my thumbs up. And I'm sad that I can't do any more than this. Everyone that just has a slight interest in an RPG needs to give this game a try. Farewell Geralt.

898,Posted: August 6,57.9 hrs on record,"Me and my friend had a kickass time playing this game and enjoyed every bit of it. It's much more action focused and lighter on story than the previous games, which makes sense for a coop game. It was mostly run n gun shooting, blasting, dismembering, cleaving, frying the nazis all the way, which we appreciate. The are plenty of lulls however that allow for exploration and investigation (reminding me of portal 2). Been trying it in singleplayer quite a bit, which is still fun as the AI doesn't get in the way too much, and generally holds fire when you attempt stealth. In coop stealth lasts about a minute before someone ♥♥♥♥s up, which is fun anyway.Story is really straightforward, but it leaves more questions than answers (the mysterious fate of certain characters). It makes me wonder what they are planning for Wolfenstein III, as they kinda opened a bunch of new possibilities with the ending.Mad props to Machine Games for delivering a fun, very replayable entry. And the art department especially for creating a visually interesting world, as always.",1 person found this review helpful,Recommended

913,Posted: August 5,14.3 hrs on record,"DON'T LISTEN TO THE HYPEA bunch of fools angry at Bethesda's catastrophic performance with Fallout 76 have fallen in love with the Witcher 3 and CD Projekt Red, worshiping them as ""the saviors of gaming.""  Don't pay attention to those neckbeards.This game sucks balls.  It's hot garbage that no one should touch with a ten foot pole.  Let's go over it:It runs like ♥♥♥♥.  The performance is among the most pathetic I've ever seen, despite how the game looks hideous anyways.The story is the most boring thing you'll ever experience.  Unless you're balls deep into the lore like the neckbeard fans, you won't understand anything.  Imagine every crappy fiction trope you've ever seen, and then combine that with a completely uninteresting scenario.  The entire game feels like endless quests.  You need to do this so you ask this guy for info, he says he'll tell you if you do this for him, to do that for him you need to get info from this other guy, he says he'll give you that info if you do this quest for him.  It's not fun in the slightest.The combat is horrible.  Practically unplayable on keyboard and a horrid no matter what.  Every fight just boils down to a few button combination that you just hit again, and again, and again, and again.  If you play on anything higher then easy every enemy is a rock hard bullet sponge, while if you play on easy there's no challenge.The smash-and-grab item collection elements of any RPG are present here: and a disaster.  The amount of pointless items is astounding, and the absurdity of the way things like potions are done is stupifying.RPG elements of speech are pretty ridiculous.  Like Fallout 4, the man you play as doesn't actually say what the game offers you, he makes some similar statement.  This constantly results in scenario's of ""that's not what I meant"" and ""seriously now I'm locked down this path?""The missions.  Oh, the missions.  In an action RPG, the sidequests should be the name of the god damn game.  Here: they disappoint like every other part of the game.  They are monotone and unintuitive.  But beyond that: they lack effort.  There's a general feeling that no actual effort was put in place.  Let me give you an example.  When playing Skyrim or Fallout New Vegas, I love to get into moods of ""what if I do this"" and perhaps take a not so scripted path to the mission.  For instance if a choice is provided to me and I see a way that I could do the mission my own way (perhaps having a conversation option after finding something, and in that conversation option I open up a new choice for how to do the mission).  That is constantly present in Bethesda and Obsidian RPG's.  In Witcher 3?  No.  Never.  Instead it's ♥♥♥♥ you: do the mission the way we told you to.  It's ridiculous, frustrating, and simply demonstrates low quality game design.The truth is that this game is not worth getting at any price.  Hell, you shouldn't play this game if someone PAYS YOU.  Easily one of the WORST games I've ever played.",3 people found this review helpful4 people found this review funny,Not Recommended

947,Posted: August 4,80.1 hrs on record,"By far one of the best games i've ever ownedI got the game of the year edition on sale because i was recommended this game multiple times by multiple friends. There are multiple reasons i love this game.1. Too much contentthis game has an overwhelming amount of content. i have 39 hours invested in this game and i haven't even beaten all side quests, main story line, or the expansions. in fact, there were so many quests that i leveled up faster than i could complete all of them. This means i would definitely have to go through another playthrough just to experience all the missed contracts/quests. There are upgrades for armor and weapons, treasure locations, endless monsters, and so much land to explore. I tried to do what i did on elder scrolls games and just find all the places of power and treasure spots before doing the main storyline but there's literally too much to do! also the storyline is just so good i HAD to return to it.2. GraphicsI can't believe the graphics on this game for when it was made. so beautiful. little details like the weather, flowing of cloth, and peoples reactions really bring this game to life3. immersive storywhat you say and do to people really has an affect on the story and where it can lead. you often get to choose what kind of person the character you're playing as is.(particularly when playing as Ciri and Geralt).4. Injected HumorThere are plenty of moments where i laughed my ♥♥♥ off at this game! I dont want to ruin it for you so you'll have to figure out what im talking about.Now onto the bad though it's nearly insignificant to me1. too much contentIf you try to focus on little side quests instead of the main story. you may get a little bored. Also, the dandelion quests were kind of dull to me, i dont know why but i didn't really enjoy them too much.2. bugsSometimes ill walk into town and random people around me start screaming and running even thought there's absolutely no danger present. I never attack anyone, i never draw my sword, i never cast any spells, and there are literally no fights going around. Also, there's some clipping here and there. one cutscene geralt was hiding behind a rock from a giant and had his arm thrust into a rock. But no biggie lol.3. Some CutscenesI'm not gonna lie. I honestly think this is just me but the cutscenes are just a bit too long sometimes and i find myself skipping through them. Im kind of impatient and just wanna kill monsters in the game sometimes.Overalli payed 20 dollars for the game of the year edition. But is it worth 50? YES. it absolutely is. CD projekt red is an amazing company and just because this game was so good i'm definitely getting Cyberpunk. Welp, thats the review.

972,Posted: August 3,142.4 hrs on record,"I always heard so much praise for this game and been saving it for soooooooooooo long. Now, I don't know why. Sure, the graphics are really good, writing is good too, some quests are funny af, but the gameplay is trash and combat made me miss W1.You start the game searching for Yen. This starting area is pretty easy, to teach you stuff, and I scoured it left and right, went to every POI and left at lvl 3. Then you go to the next map that has recommended level 5, most mobs (lvl 5-7) are in herds so it can be sometimes hard as they can stun-lock you in ""got hurt animations"" where you have no control over the character.  Another thing is, on lvl 4, I picked a Q recommended for lvl 3 and the stupid ♥♥♥ game puts a lvl 12 soaker, which also sends me into a loading screen in two hits, with other 4 mobs right. ♥♥♥♥ing. next to it. And you can't do ♥♥♥♥, just hit-roll-hit-roll for 10 minutes.Many Q are escorts or do/fetch/collect 10 things one by one in every stage with lots of pointless chatter in between that is impossible to keep up with or skip at once (needs mashing skip button) to artificially prolong the gameplay.Almost every action has animation that can't be canceled (that will bite you in the ♥♥♥ many times).Speaking of animations, your character does not follow the mouse, you have to point camera in direction you want to turn and move. Can't turn on spot so you'll be falling from small, high places a lot. It makes looting or navigating in tight areas a huge pain in the ♥♥♥ sometimes. BJ sitting in cripplecar in Wolf had better mobility than this.There are no ""difficulty zones"", as lvl 4 at one POI you kill 3 lvl 7s no problem, walk 50 steps away from there and you might get ♥♥♥♥♥ by lvl 18... or 5 of them and only way to see the monster level is to come close and get chased by it halfcros the map to not get iked. Combat is mostly with soakers and very, very repetitive. Visit poi, look what is there, read bestiary, go to inventory, dig through dozen potions and oils that look all the same, apply the correct ones, kill all, loot, move to the next one.  Horses are bugy, get stuck all the time or spawns somewhere unreachable, stops sprinting and controls stop responding randomly, mounted attack has 2 sec delay for some reason, game switches equiped trophy on its own.Too many worthless recipes and other crafting trash. If you explore you'll find better stuff and if you don't explore you will not have resources to craft them anyway. It is a huge mess, hard to navigate in.How the ♥♥♥♥ does drinking booze and meditating replenish hand granades?Speech options are unclear, like FO4, sometime you'll get that ""wtf, not what I meant"" moment.When on a Q you can pass area of another Q and start it, which sucks if that other Q is for 10 level higher character.Attacks have a little delay- has to do one or two pirouettes before the slash for some reason.Swimming is bugy, sometimes can't dive (gets stuck legs up) or dives and emerges back up right away or can't get out of water (on shore).Geralt keeps falling/roling downstairs.Cursor from menu bugs out and stays visible ingame.Caranthir spawned unkillable idle posing, no weapon, no hitboxesToo much level dependency, restricts gameplay, makes it grindy, boring.Sharpening swords is time limited, but oils are for certain number of cuts, kinda backwards.Some quests will lock you up from collectibles (gwent), kinda like that one Barenziah stone in Skyrim, or the cave in Far cry 3. Random CTDs, mainly during transit-loading-cutscenes or upon entering quest location.Modding is a pain in the ♥♥♥.There is also this general stupidity in the gameplay, like, those mega powerful companion mages (Tris, Yen) do ♥♥♥♥all dmg in combat. Ciri does not use teleport power to not attract Wild Hunt, but during combat teleports like a mofo. Hundreds of monsters, bandits, looters, vills, yet there is loot everywhere and *another settlement needs your help* coz some poor ♥♥♥♥er went alone into monster infested swamp. MAKE UP YOR MIND, FFS! Sometimes I wonder who the ♥♥♥♥ does playtesting for these game studios. Either they're just a bunch of yes-men scared for their job or if they are actually ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.Edit: Got further in the game, many edits, still ♥♥♥♥ed.",3 people found this review helpful2 people found this review funny,Not Recommended

I would definitely say this game is worth at all full price as it was an incredibly addicting game with a wonderful storyline and great characters. Overall I'd definitely give gwent a 10/10. There was also this kinda random side quest where you go and try to find some girl with white hair or something and fight some dudes called like the ""Wild Hunt"" i think, and I guess that was pretty alright especially since it came free with the game.",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

Yennefer is acc a beauty. You have the choice to romance Yennefer or Triss and there is more detail to that than I thought. This game is very well optimised and graphics are better than most games nowadaysRunning on: RTX 2080Ti + R7 2700, completely maxed out with hairworks i dont dip below 144FPS - This is critical to the game so you can stare at Ciri and Yennefer in the cutscenes flawlessly.",1 person found this review helpful,Recommended

It does not compare to this game, but is still great, and while it is not vital to understanding the story it helps you get used to the world and to the characters.Just don't play the first game.If you think that CD Projekt Red was always so great at graphics and mechanics...
