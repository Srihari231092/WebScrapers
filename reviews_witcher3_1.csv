2,Posted: August 1,161.2 hrs on record,"Bigger but much shallower than the previous two installments. I would advise focusing on the main quest, otherwise the fetching and button mashing combat quickly become annoying. I was always torn between my impulse to explore the content and the fact that most of it was disappointing. The constant piling of gloom also makes it a somewhat depressing experience, with the liveliness and humor of Witcher 2 and especially 1 quite hard to find. In the end, stopped playing and just watched Youtube videos to get the end of the story, and I should have done that from the get go.",1 person found this review helpful1 person found this review funny,Not Recommended

5,Posted: August 1,164.5 hrs on record,"I dont even know where to start, there is so much to talk about this masterpiece, I could spend hours writing about it yet 4 years since the release there is nothing new to be said about, from the beautiful graphics and astonishing landscapes (from Novigrad a medieval city, to Toussaint remembering a south french city in the coast of the Mediterranean, Skellige isles, and I could be on and on), the soundtrack is amazing as well, really made the battles feel more epic, yet it could make you feel more relaxed, just appreciate the vibe and relax, the legendary Priscilla´s song in the Inn, is one example.   To the gameplay itself, the combat is a bit buggy, when facing opponents you cant jump, and for example when fistfighting there is a lot of times you get stuck, which is annoying yet they are minor problems, and the combat overall is very well done, there are hundreds of combos with the use of signs, strong, fast attacks, bombs , including awesome finishers, another thing its worth mentioning is the movement, Geralt movement is fine in the general, the same could not be said about roach´s movement, the horse movement in the overral is acceptable, nevertheless he gets stuck a lot, once again unimportant problems in the overall experience    Now the gameplay content, this is the reason why this game differentiates itself from others, there is so much to do, this game can easily give you 300 hours of gameplay ( which in a singleplayer game is a remarkable feat), without doing the same over and over again, from witcher contracts to secondary quests that can be as good or even better than the main plot, to the famous Gwent game, a cards game, that now even is a game by his own, to the simple exploration that can be very very rewarding, reaching the corners of the map can give you legendary items, rare pieces of lore, and much much more.    To conclude, buy this game, even if you dont like RPG´s, just buy it and thank me later, I bought it during a steam sale for 14,99 euros including DLC´s, which is a steal, but even for 30 euros this game is worthy of every penny you spend, I cannot say this about 99 percent of other games, but CD Projekt Red really deserves all praise they get, they are the oasis in the desert in today´s gaming industry, giving you an example the Wine and Blood DLC, if made by any other corporation it could be easily a game, the amount of content, hours, the map size it can give you is absurd in a good way.Giving a rate to this game I would give a 9,8/10, if there is a game that its close to perfection this is the game, the 20k players that every day play it despite being a 4 year old singleplayer game confirms this.",1 person found this review helpful,Recommended

8,Posted: August 1,384.1 hrs on record,"Everything about the game is good, only thing they could have probably done better was to not let the  DLC packs start until the main quest was completed so that the world would reflect the correct state during the DLC  game play, for example, I got Nilfgaardian Army to win the war but throughout the DLC's Novigrad was still being ruled by Radovid and that didn't feel good.But all in all a true gamer's delight",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

22,Posted: July 31,188.4 hrs on record,"I got this game when it first came out, and man did it take my breath away.  This is downright my favorite game to date, the graphics and game play are glorious. I've never seen a more beautiful. The story is wonderfully done, the characters are gold, and the length of the main story is so long and so good that I have replayed it 3 times, 3 different ways. Not to mention the DLCs which are also pure gold and longer than some full games.This is a game that you can easily sink into it hundreds of hours of your time, and feel like you have never spent your time more wisely.  I have over 180+ hours on steam, over 300+ hours including my first copy I had for my xbox. This is one of those games you have to play, its already in my mind a classic that will be remembered.

27,Posted: July 31,122.1 hrs on record,"The Witcher 3 was recommended to me by my brother way back, I remember it releasing with all the fuss around it (nothing negative mind you) and for less than a month it was the conversation of the day at the office I worked at. But at the time I was still too busy playing Dark Souls back at home. (I didn't have enough time for everything due to my work/study so I had to manage it) Some time passed, then the GOTY edition came out. All it needed was a sale for me to get it. I had never played a Witcher title previously, and I had some doubts after I was told the first and second were really rough around the edges. But I did some reading and watched some summaries, so I was mentally prepared. And just sat down for a night to play.There's one thing one needs to know about me. And that's that I do not care much for RPG's littered with stats, levels, costumization, and who knows what else. It's a lot of tacky junk to me, on a game that needs it's core mechanics and handling to work first and foremost. I'm lazy and I just put all my points into strength to begin with. World-building and storytelling however, can suck me in. If the world is believable, rich, and organic you will probably have my attention. And Witcher 3 most certainly did! And as those parts fall into place, I become more open to the RPG elements the game has to offer, but ONLY then.First and foremost, I'm surprised by all the visual detail, the game looks amazing! Forests are lush and deliciously European looking, with lots to find while exploring. Lovely during daytime, but legitimately scary at night. Cities are vast and the buildings look legit, some are even based on existing ones in Poland it seems. And then there's the story surrounding it all, riddled with mysteries, magic, horror and tragedy. The quests are very creative, I don't remember any of them boring me. And while Geralt, as a character, is kind-of monotone and emotionless, you'll be able to fill in the parts his base character is initially missing yourself. And if that doesn't work for you, there's many characters surrounding Geralt that'll hold your attention. I'm trying to refrain from being too spoilery, so excuse me when I seem vague here and there.It's been a while since I've spent this many hours in a game, and I haven't even finished the second DLC yet. There are two in total actually, and both I VERY much recommend! I'd even say the writing and scenarios in those seem way more polished than the base game. Especially the second, with an entirely new region, enemies, characters, and a new storyline. It actually blew my mind playing it, it's nuts. CDProject has a new fan, one who is very much looking forward to trying their new title; Cyberpunk 2077!",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended
28,Posted: July 31,40.0 hrs on record,I believe that this game is one of if not the best game of this generation with an experience that does not even come close to any other games of this generation with most of them being horrible online games which seems to keep getting more and more popular this game shows how immersive and amazing a singleplayer game can be especially since this game came out in 2015 which shows that singleplayer games can still be great even this and even next generation this game gives gaming hope.,No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

30,Posted: July 31,52.5 hrs on record,"What can i say that hasn't be already.The story of this game is one of the best in recent years also with many great and unique characters and it is also filled with many choices that few RPG's have these days . There are also ton of unique side quests, witcher contracts and treasure hunts that fill the game.  The world is dark and filled with rich history and lore(although confusing at times). Every location is beautiful and unique in its own way. The gameplay is really good with many different and diverse enemies with different potions, bombs, poisons, oils, decoctions and magical signs that can help you with slaying them and the bosses are really cool and well designed(albeit really easy). The soundtrack is really beautiful and fitting in the different areas and situations that you can find yourself in. To summarize:Story: AmazingGameplay: Really goodCharacters: Awesome each with their own and unique backstoryGraphics and environment: Beautiful Soundtrack: Beautiful and fittingWorld: Dark and with unique history and loreDid i mention that there are no microtransactions at all?So for those who have not bought it and are interested in RPGs and games with a good story: Buy it, you wont regret a thing.",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

I can't turn a corner without a fight I know this is the case in every video game but it just seems extra ridiculous in thisa lot of quests are based on the lore of previous games and they don't really work to provide enough context to fill you in, but the previous games are far far worse so unless you torture yourself it's gonna be weirdremember how wonderful in shadow of the colossus when you would whistle for your horse and it would run past you so while you were running you could swiftly hop on it and the momentum and timing of it was ♥♥♥♥ing perfect and beautiful?this doesn't have that at all. when you call your horse in this he walks sorta near you sorta and then you have to hold a button and slowly get on his dumb ♥♥♥. and then it's not worth it anyway cause he'll get stuck on every piece of scenery on the way and randomly stray from the path you're supposed to be onsometimes the stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in sidequests who you just agreed to help will give you generic dialogue like ""♥♥♥♥ off while you still got legs"" while you're ♥♥♥♥ing saving their stupid ♥♥♥♥ life and they'll be all surprised and ♥♥♥♥ when you use witcher powers why the ♥♥♥♥ am I capped at the number of abilities I'm allowed to equipthis is consistently one of the least fun and most frustratingly obnoxious mechanics I've ever come across, it's in mutant road zero as wellyou'll have multiple quests available and it simply won't show them on the map, so you have to go to the quest page choose a quest and go back to the map page to see how close a quest objective is to you, it's such an incredible pain in the ♥♥♥ I can't believe they couldn't figure out a better way to do itthis is a game where every second mechanic has me asking why they even bothered to include that mechanicwhy does the horse have a stamina gauge? is it because the devs played Ocarina of Time?granted there are a couple mini quest horse race things you can do where it matters but did they really think that hampering your means of travel for the entire game was worth a mini game?this ♥♥♥♥ keeps me up at night, I'm writing this 30 minutes past my bed time cause I just can't get over how stupid this iswhen you're in your inventory looking at a weapon or piece of armor it doesn't even show a stat comparison with what you're wearing, it just shows if the base damage or base armor is higher. this is ♥♥♥♥ing pathetic, the weapons and armor have a lot of other buffs that are on them but all it'll give you is ""+3"" like big ♥♥♥♥ing deal I want to know how this fares against necrophages or what it blocks or whatever and I have to flick between two things. so awfula lot of sidequests have completely unsatisfying conclusions and it feels like it's because there are questions you're just not allowed to ask, like there's some forced stupidity so that no matter what there's something bad that happens. Save the orphans? a village is destroyed. Save the village? orphans are eaten. can you talk to the spirit that's gonna eat orphans and stop it? no. can you talk to the spirit about why it would destroy the village or ask it its motivations? no.so you may wonder of me ""jakuzi if you're so smart and handsome why don't you just avoid the sidequests if you don't like them?"" and that's a good question but here's the thing. the main storyline has so many RPG plot driven doors that you basically can't avoid sidequests. I'm sent by a king to get his daughter. someone who has information about that daughter won't give it to me until I help him find his daughter and wife. I have to go ask two other people for help. one of them makes me find his goat before he helps me. then the guy with the information that I need reveals that I have to help him save the soul of his wife's miscarriage. then him and the guy with the goat ask me to go to a swamp. then I meet a little boy who knows another little boy who knows about some witches who want me to kill a creature that lives under a tree in another city. that's another 4-6 quests right there. you see what I'm ♥♥♥♥ing talking about?one of the main quests is ridiculous, it constantly has you coming back to town to talk to one guy but the town is walled off so you have to follow this stupid long twisting path even after fast travelling just to talk to the ♥♥♥♥ing baron for the 5th ♥♥♥♥ing time it's garbagegeneric high fantasy (just go read black company instead of playing this for the plot)you'll wonder what's wrong with this kind of silly main character, he makes quips at ghosts like he's some kind of action hero and it seems sort of dumb. maybe he just needs to hype himself up but this game would be improved if geralt were a mutea combat system that's restricted to essentially 4 actions (it's fine it's just not a draw)a crafting system that's in every other big RPG (time to carry around 59 lbs of garbage in case you intend on making something later)wheeeeeemaybe you want to skip through individual lines of dialogue to speed up cutscenes cause you're literatewelp 10% of the time that skips an entire scene instead of skipping just the line you're ongreatsometimes you'll use the stun spell and the opponent will keep backing up despite being stunned and your attack combo pulls you out of keira's protective shield and you die cause the air hurts and then you have to wait a ♥♥♥♥ing eternity to refight these enemies that aren't even difficult they're just irritatingthis also has that most loved of all action rpg mechanicsweapon degradation!!!!!1!11!!1! yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaybest I can say is that it's not a huge problem in this because you're constantly getting gear that's barely an upgrade anyway so all your weaponry is essentially redundantyou still have to go find a big town if you want to repair a weapon or craft a new one but don't fretthere's fast travelexcept it only works if you're in specifics placesthus defeating the purpose of fast travel almost entirelywheeeethe game is mysteriously dark, I know devs and gamers don't tend to go outside but here's a tip: the sun is BRIGHT and it makes your body and mind feel good.it's still better than the first two witchers by farthe writing is perfectly fine, I don't actually think combat is the worst but by no means is it really the draw of the gamegraphics are kind of muddy at times, making it hard to tell what's going on or where you should be going but I guess that's intentional for some reason because they have a potion that negates thismaybe just read the ♥♥♥♥ing booksoh let's not forget it has the obligatory kind of boring mini game of Gwentat least unlike Blitzball or whatever garbage I actually know some people who enjoy itstill a poor addition tho",3 people found this review helpful2 people found this review funny,Not Recommended

74,Posted: July 29,30.3 hrs on record,"I have a somewhat unpopular opinion on this game, I really didn't enjoy my time with The Witcher 3. I am not attempting to invalidate the extreme praise this game received or say that it doesn't deserve it all I am saying is that I have some major problems with the game that soured the experience for me. The first is the combat, it is very simplistic and somewhat unrefined hits don't register occasionally and the enemies don't react like they should when hit with a sword. The story is ok and well voice acted but I felt it was somewhat disconjointed because it sometimes felt as if you are doing things that are completely unnecessary and were in the game just so that the devs could say that had lots of content. The world also felt bland and uninteresting. So again to reiterate I don't wish to tear down this game and if you value deep moral choices over satisfying combat and fun exploration then I would recommend this game however if you are in the camp of people (like me) who value exploration over story then I would have to recommend that you go and chose a different open world game",3 people found this review helpful2 people found this review funny,Not Recommended

85,Posted: July 29,55.0 hrs on record,"A brilliant tale of a man that, against all forces, stands for what is right. Even though Geralt is meant to remain neutral (and you can if that's what you choose), he still ultimately bases his decisions on right and wrong.I have not played the prior games, but that should not stop you, it didn't stop me and I am fully immersed in the world of The Witcher!The story is gripping and does not kill your immersion by forcing you to know the events of the previous games like so many triple A titles do nowadays. Aside from this, it helps ease you into the world by offering loads of dialogue to help you piece previous game's events together, while keeping the story moving forward at the same time due to the incredible amount of time and effort put into the writing of this game.On the surface, it seems like another RPG whereby the player is sent one place to kill or retrieve something, rinse repeat. But no, no this game has many special quests and unique charm. There is a lot of political nuances dotted without, relationships between the characters that actually make you empathize with them, love, death and betrayal, all attributed to an immense open world and great story telling. The game is by no means easy either, so If you want a challenge, this game will break you on the harder difficulties but it is well worth it. Studying the bestiary, drinking potions/decoctions and preparing for a fight, only to finally slay that monster? There are few games that deliver such a feeling of satisfaction and accomplishment like this.Overall, a great game which I have no doubt in my mind will become a timeless classic. CD Projekt Red have truly out-done themselves. If this series' success is anything to go by, CD Projekt Red's next game: Cyberpunk 2077 will be worth EVERY penny.I highly recommend this game!",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

103,Posted: July 28,111.1 hrs on record,"I didn't really like Witcher 1.  I didn't play Witcher 2.  I decided to grab this on sale and see what all the hype was about.  This is where I landed.I remember playing Oblivion back in the day thinking to myself ""wow, these quests are really unique, they did such an excellent job""This game takes that to a whole new level.  Every - quest - is - unique.   They're all interesting, every single one of them.  The story is fantastic.  The open world is beautiful and fascinating.  The lore is deep, complex, and evolvingThe combat keeps the game challenging while still being fun.I didn't really like being a character with a background, or even a hero all the time, but Geralt grows on you after a while.Cons----- There IS a learning curve.  Potions are NOT just for show.  Oils take getting used to, there's nothing like them in other games really. Crafting is a necessity for higher difficulties.  Skills have to be placed in a slot before they're active.      Fortunately all of this only takes about 2 hours to get accustomed to, but it is not immediately intuitive. - The save system is old school and kind of obnoixous- Fall damage is stupid.  Just be careful and you'll be fine- I personally like the not-so-immediate fast travel, but others don't- The game is dominated by cutscenes.  If you don't appreciate story, background, engagement, this game isn't really for you. - The durability system is unnecessary but if you like realism then ok fine. - The weight system is honestly unnecessary but if you like realism then ok fine.All in all, I give it 10/10.   Best game I've played since AC:Black Flag and Skyrim",1 person found this review helpful,Recommended

123,Posted: July 27,266.9 hrs on record,"Cant even formulate the words to describe how good this game is in just about every single regard. The only gripes i could think of if i had a gun to my head would be the somewhat lackluster combat during the early game. you definitely have to put some time in before you get a lot of the fun and cool stuff before that its pretty much dodge swing dodge swing or roll swing roll swing. My only other gripe is that in a game that seems to give you countless opportunities to ♥♥♥♥ many chicks, all of the scenes are copy paste. You've seen one Witcher ""sex scene"" you've seen all of them.The narrative is definitely what drives the game not the combat, at least in my opinion. That being said the game has more replayability than any story driven single player game I've ever played due to the multiple endings and your decisions actually having an impact on the way things unfold in every story from The Main Story quests to every tiny little side quest along with the DLC content. While i'm on the side quests let me say do them ALL, they may sound boring when you start them but they almost always spiral into an outcome or situation you don't expect, i could come up with so many examples of this but the side quests are so good that i don't even wanna spoil them with an example. Also Buy the DLC, never have i played a game with better DLC than The Witcher 3. Many other publishers/developers would've sold Blood and Wine as a completely separate game not to downplay the amazing DLC that came before it Heart of Stone which is more traditional DLC but more than worth playing in its entirety. Both DLC have amazing stories as well as having huge gameplay/combat additions that really make the game a hell of a lot more fun. Of course talking about the Rune dude in Heart of Stone and the Mutations in Blood and Wine along with many of the very unique weapons and gear added in both. The DLC for The Witcher is in a strange place, the game is without a doubt a complete product without it but i cant imagine a playthrough without Heart of Stone and Blood and Wine it doesn't feel like DLC but just a natural progression onto the game with Blood and Wine having an amazing 4th wall breaking ending scene that really makes you feel like a truly valued player.If you want to play previous titles i suggest doing it before playing the third because the others are great games in their own right but don't age very well and again in my opinion cant hold a candle to The Witcher 3. This game also has great mod support and many amazing mods from talented creators, so if you were somebody who modded Skyrim to ♥♥♥♥ and enjoyed that you will likely love this as well granted most mods are more on the side of Graphical improvement and fidelity which is funny because the game already looks amazing, likewise if skyrim modding was a little too much for you Witcher modding is a lot simpler however a little less flexible when it comes to compatibility between mods whereas in Skyrim you could make just about anything work together if you knew what you were doing, with the Witcher Mods that's not always the case due to script limitations.In closing the game is the epitome of what an RPG should be and every other game developer should be taking notes.266 hours on the game and i haven't finished Blood and Wine yet, at 266 hours i feel like i haven't done this game justice by giving it the hours it deserves. and this isn't from some fanatical witcher fan, never read any of the books in full. The Witcher 3 was my first Witcher game, so sad to hear that its also my last, truly an artistic masterpiece in video game form.also no DRM software",No one has rated this review as helpful yet1 person found this review funny,Recommended

127,Posted: July 27,109.6 hrs on record,"Long story short, Witcher 3 is not a perfect game as the game has its own share of problems.First of all the game has quite number of bugs and glitches despite its age. Thankfully none of them are nowhere near on the level of game breaking, but they can be quite the hindrance at times. Sometimes you even have to load your previous save to resolve them.There's also a serious lack of challenge as I played the game on the hardest difficulty level and I never felt like I was having a hard time with combat. In fact I felt like the game was missing few extra difficulty notches.Then there's the slight problem with exploration. Granted, there are quite a number of locations and secrets that you can discover, but most of them generic ""go there, kill monster and find the treasure"" -type of locations which can get repetitive at times, especially if you're an completionist like I am who has to uncover 100% of the map. The Skellige exploration is extremely tedious task to do, because most of the locations are in sea and underwater. I think I've had enough of those smuggler's caches for a life time.But in the end none of those flaws really matter in the end, because the rest of what the game has to offer is phenomenal.I've been playing video games for over 2 decades now and no other games has ever affected like Witcher 3 did. Sometimes it made me laugh and sometimes it made me cry a little. Sometimes I even stopped playing and just sit back and watched the scenery while that wonderful OST played on the background. There aren't many games out there that does that for me.The main quest is remarkable and most of the side quests are well written too. The characters are rememberable and none of them felt boring.When you sum it all up Witcher 3 is probably my Game of the Decade -game and the Witcher trilogy is my favorite game trilogy ever made  (suck on that mass effect! you blew it with the ME3's ending.).It is by far my most favorite game of all time and CDPR has all my gratitude for what they gave me. It's sad to know that this is the last time we're playing as Geralt, but hopefully the Witcher franchise isn't dead yet and there' more to come, because I cannot wait to jump right back into it.Verdict: 10/10 - A score that I don't give out easily.",1 person found this review helpful,Recommended

129,Posted: July 27,139.9 hrs on record,"CONS:-Character progression. The amount of exp you get after certain missions is abysmal, but some missions give you way more exp than you really deserve for that mission. I was overleveled for most of the game which made it almost boring to slaughter the very underleveled opponents. Fortunately there is a fix in the settings that scales up the levels of underleveled opponents that made enemies significantly harder. All that being said, seeing your character become much stronger as you play is a lot of fun-Magic. I did a SpellCaster on my first play through which was a bad decision as high level magic is very boring. Most of the game is just pressing ""q"", so i would definitely recommend not doing a magic play though-The story is kinda doodoo near the end. Most of the game is dedicated to you finding a character named Ciri, which your character has a long history with, but after you are finished looking for her the story is a large downhill slide from there. Not to mention, getting the ""good"" ending requires you to do certain sidequests that are actually part of the story. Only problem with that is that none of those sidequests are marked as having anything to do with the story, and the only reason I ended up doing them is because if you progress too far in the story, you fail them, so I would get a random ""quest failed"" and then reload a previous save to complete that quest. However, getting the best ending and seeing the fruits of all your decisions is very satisfying.-Bugs, are pretty prevalent in the game. Then can be funny at times, like seeing a guard phase into the person with which you are having a conversation, but they also ruin your immersion a lot, and some of the bugs can result in your death or you needing to load a previous save.PROS:-The graphics are wonderful, obviously it will be hell on your computer, but playing on the ""high"" graphics settings made the game visually stunning. Many of the monsters and even the world are intentionally ugly to elicit feelings of dread or make you feel gross, but they do such a wonderful job of making you feel what it intends to.-The world is huge, almost too huge. You can spend hours exploring the world if that is your thing.-The enemies are spot on. Some of them are absolutely disgusting, some of them are beautiful. In addition the combat can be tough (i play on the highest difficulty), but it is very rewarding to topple giant beasts or super hard bosses.-The decisions. You make a bunch of moral decisions throughout the game which all have huge impacts on the story and the world. Some of these decisions are very obvious, but some of them aren't as much, but, overall, they really add to the game.OVERALL:I really like the game, all of its pros and cons wrap up to be just a truly fantastic game.",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

So, when the GOTY was given to The Witcher 3 instead MGS V i was hella mad about it. To be honest ive never taken rpg games seriously as they are not my bread and butter.But after 4 years, oh boy oh boy. IDK what struck my mind, i decided to give this game a go and how grateful i am to myself that i did. Damn man, this game is the best game ive ever played hands down.The main story is so compelling, the side quests are so unique. i have never played a game where ive thought what im doing is repetitive in some way, but here i enjoyed every and each bit of the world. You feel your choices have consequences, and its not black and white choices. Most of the time while u play this game you keep debating with yourself about the choice made, wether it was right or wrong? this is probably the best part of the game, there is no good or evil its all grey. Not only do the main missions but side missions, hell even those witcher contracts make u feel so invested and make u take those damn hard decisions.It took me 120 hrs to complete the base game, do u remember when was the last time u spend so much time just on one games base version? i doubt u have ever. Both expansions HOS and BOW are game in themselves, Gaunter O'Dimm is one of the most scariest characters ive seen in a video game, that boi still gives me chills. While BOW makes u question your morale. I bet  anyt other gaming studio would release  BOW as a new game itself, it was that big. All in all it took me 50 hrs to complete both the expansions. 170hrs and that too just for my 1st playthrough, there are so many different paths i could have taken. So many outcomes i could have witnessed, and the amount of money im paying is priceless.CD Project Red, while other developers  are busy scheming how to take more money from the consumers.

142,Posted: July 26,194.8 hrs on record,"First off, I wanna say I wholeheartedly recommend this game to any and every one.The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a masterpiece. The game was launched in 2015 but all it's secrets have yet to be discovered. The game has a rich world, immersive story and incredible artwork and music. This must be one of the greatest games in existence, alongside industry-changing names like The Legend of Zelda and Dark Souls.The ensnaring characters and their very real moral choices breath life into the game, creating an experience with no equal. Without noticing it, you begin to feel deeply for the people in the game, and I think I can say with certainty that there isn't a single person that has played this game that doesn't absolutely adore Geralt.Above all else, The Witcher is a game about choices, and how those choices affect the world around you in sometimes devastating ways. The game gives you freedom and every choice seems meaningful. For the first time, I found myself staring at the screen for 10 minutes considering the moral choice presented to me. This game makes you think about right and wrong in a life-changing way, because there isn't always a right and a wrong, sometimes, right and wrong are morphed, blended together in a single ethical and moral mess. Can blackmail justify murder? Does an abusive childhood justify your criminal acts? Can you blame a man for wanting revenge on those who killed his family? Is all life worth the same or do some people just deserve to die? The Witcher 3 and it's dilemmas are still very relevant and they will stay that way for years to come.This game has changed the way we view storytelling in video games, and it will be a staple of it's time long after its release. I've put almost 200 hours into this game and have got every achievement, but have yet to play all the quests, let alone explore every single aspect of a world with no perceivable end.Absolutely recommend, worth the full price and everything, it's a beautiful experience, and I wish I could have my ""first playthrough"" one more time.TL;DR Great game, very good storytelling, beautiful world, story, characters, art and music, recommended.",1 person found this review helpful,Recommended

147,Posted: July 26,270.4 hrs on record,"After playing the game for 88 hours, I’ve had enough negative aspects to deem a negative review. Was on the fence about an Up or Down review but the Dev’s screwing me on Exp points was the last nail in the coffin. I shouldn’t be forced to play missions only to get 1 exp point for the SOLE reason my char level is too high for what the Dev’s consider. What I somewhat like about Witcher 3:Huge open world that I can pick and choose where and what I wish to complete. (will get 1exp point if char level is too high on missions)Crafting/upgrading with all the many different aspects that are involved. Finding around 2000+ different types of gear to steal/acquire, harvest, modify, buy or sell. 20+ treasure, witcher contracts, 2nd story quests are at times daunting but fun to pick the ones to complete next. (many are about 30ish minutes to fully complete. Some give 150-250 Exp points others give 1 Exp point) If you don’t care about leveling up so your char cant use or wear some cool witcher gear, then this game is for you – (Heavy Sarcasm) Main story quickly gets muddled with 50 or so of each side quests. These do help get the main char (slowly) upgrade to a strong enough XP level that can actually do something without dying. I found that a few can be completed/failed by completing other main quests (If you choose the random correct questions)Love how this game brings back very fond memories of the original Diablo and Drakan Order of the flame. Both games had ‘find your own weapons to make your player better’ which was huge for that time era. Drakan holds a special area in my heart… (By-the-way Drakan doesn’t d1ck around with Exp points. Perhaps this is why it holds a special place in my heart)What I Don’t like about the game: B1tchery included. It’s a bit longAs far as the storylines go, there are so many bloody choices that’s it’s hard to know what the outcome will be in the end. Saving every 5-10 min helped if a choice turned to be a bad one but some missions are decided upon other missions. If you chose wrong, then you’ll never get some missions.Don’t like how some crafting components are very rare that I have to google where these monsters/flowers/potions are at or at lease buy them somewhere.When in ‘battle stance mode’ Dev’s please allow the player to: Jump; fast travel; Run.I can’t tell you how frustrating it is to want to jump over the smallest of terrain but can’t, to Quickly back away from the enemy but can’t, to side step around the enemy (while using your sword) but can’t or to try and fast travel to any other location but can’t when in ‘battle stance mode’. Very frustrating when the map area changes so quickly from ‘easy’ to ‘you will die within 2 swipes from monsters’. Monster(s) of “??” power level comes out and within literally two swipes of claws you find that you’re dead. Oh, Man! I really love how the Dev’s thought that was a great idea to put in the game! Let’s NOT tell the player what the level of the monster is as it must be above 90 so let’s put a “??” in to let the player know they are about to get r@ped ragged.Like nearly all free roaming games, the main char gets into some goofy camera angles or gets stuck between some trees or cant seem to go up some simple stairs. The small things gets irritating when you keep finding the movement isn’t fluid. Not fond of the idea that when you’re at level 7 that the better 3-rune-swords are being kept by level 15 monsters. I spend time Slowly leveling up my Char to a proper level 11 witcher silver sword. Come back and kill the level 15 monster just to see that the sword you get is a level 6 sword! WTF!So if the point was to get ½ the money that the sword lists for in inventory at some armory place and not actually use the bloody thing, then this makes sense. If the point is to make the player fight 8 levels higher than what his current level is at then I’m not sure how well this plan was thought out Dev’s. Another quick example is when I was at level 14, I killed THREE level 21 Forktials which took me 12 min rolling around healing myself. At the end I got a level 11 silver sword. FTW Dev’s! Are we reaching for killing monsters 10 levels above us? I guess we are to sell all swords and craft just the witcher ones. (Loud sarcastic clapping and whistling heard in the background).Looting in front of guards, they attack you but you don’t die!! They take nearly all your coin that you spent Mmm lets say 10 hours of Real-World-Time to painstakingly kill off a few hundred monsters and men, looting everything, wait painstakingly wait a long time for amours and blacksmiths to come back with more coin, decide what you wish to sell, upgrade or repair, only to find that all this time you slowly accumulated precious coin IS ALL ****ING GONE!! Ice pick someone in the ****ing carotid artery then using the drying blood for paints on a canvas in the shape of a big middle finger! R@ping of exp points in quests!! Take in 88 real world hours to run around building my Char exp points up to make it a bit easier to go back and complete missions that are at a lower level. You will find that the Dev’s PURPOSELY wrote code so that you get 1 or 2 exp points. There is no manual, no notes, nothing to tell you they want you to go into the missions BELOW your char level. WHY, WHY, WHY!!!! Why put a max char level 70 when we can beat the game at level 32 or so! That’s less than half!! Why adjust the exp points at all! Who @#%* cares if I spent 100 hours making my char higher so that I can kill with one sword swipe! I play a game to enjoy the game. Thus the GAME (not this one but speaking for all games in general) was invented to be enjoyed. When the game is no longer enjoyed as the Dev’s are punishing me for my 88 hours getting to level 19 so I can play level 12 contracts with ease, giving me ONE EXP POINT = NEGATIVE REVIEW!!!!! BOLD, UNDERLINE, CIRLED, ITALICIZED ect, ect, ect. This is why I have over 300 hours of Far Cry3 where I replayed that game 9 times! there’s no silly r@ping of my exp points. I spend 40 hours getting the best weapons then going back and mow down lesser men with jubilee and elation on my face. Of which I still get my full exp points upon completion!I may understand why the exp points are somehow ‘recommended’ by the cursed Dev’s to finish the game around char level 33, then why, Why! have a max char level of 70!! There are countless other players posting they only played the main story and finish game with char level 35 or screwed around doing lots of other side missions and ended game with char level 34. If the game wanted me to ignore the 80 or so witcher contracts and 2nd side missions then WHY! even put them in the game to only give me 1 EXP POINTS!!! Why even bother putting in all the thousands of bandit camps, caves, places of power, random loot chests, ect ect if I can ignore them all and focus on the main storyline to give me the Dev’s “Recommended” finish with a char level of 35. Someone CLEARLY did NOT think that one through. Defeats the Entire point of making the game Open world if we are going to be punished for playing in the open world. If the Dev’s meant to give us 1 exp point, then make the game linear forcing us to go down the path “THEY” want us to. WTF! Its’s as if the Dev’s have absolutely NO CLUE how gamers play open world games. If I complete a mission that takes us around 30ish minutes to complete, WE WANT TO BE REWARDED BY NORMAL EXP POINTS. It’s like a slap in the face giving 1 exp points. Why should I even bother with these missions for if I’m not going to get any reward?? = NEGATIVE REVIEW.(Heavy Sigh)The game is really cool and I love many aspects of it but playing it is like any great drink, too much too soon will leave some bile in your throat followed by curse word(s).",4 people found this review helpful,Not Recommended

155,Posted: July 26,73.9 hrs on record,"This is, without a shadow of a doubt, my favourite game of all time. It has some of the best in-game storytelling out of any video game by far, with such in depth lore & character development that it's truly incredible how they have managed to pack so much into one game without it exploding my computer on the spot. The characters in this game have such depth & genuine feel to this game that I was truly invested in ALL of their stories.One scene for example in the beginning of the game shows the main protagonist Geralt be taught how to greet royalty, they didn't have to do, CD Projekt Red could've simply just had a quest marker over the guys head, but instead they took the time to go in-depth in the storytelling like no game I have ever seen before. It shows how much care & attention has gone into this game's storytelling. The actual gameplay is also incredible, whilst it is incredibly more in depth than it needs to be (most of the time the combat can be won with the stun & smack) i still find myself trying not to go for the cheap route & win the most badass way possible. It's still a joy to see the combat be as fluent & impactful as it is, with Geralt being seen to fight with such grace that it is such a joy to watch. The world & side missions are also a true joy to play, with each of them being so fun to complete from beginning to end that it'll never get old for me. One thing in particular that I want to point out is the DLC for this game is THE BEST DLC TO BE SOLD FOR A GAME with Blood & Wine being such an amazing DLC, packed with such enriching new side quests, an entire new map to play in, & a incredibly touching & intense mystery main plot that I'm truly surprised that they didn't make it a stand alone game.Of course I recommend this game as you can tell, one thing I must though is that you must give this game your time to truly appreciate it. It has a few faults but no game is perfect (Except Portal) & I think that everyone should play this game. Rating: Yes",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

179,Posted: July 25,23.3 hrs on record,"Tried Witcher 2 on consoles years ago and couldn't quite get into it.On a whim I picked up the GOTY edition of Wild Hunt and let me just tell you I could not have been more surprised that I slept on this franchise till 2019. The third entry is a massive, engaging world littered with interesting characters/quests, quick events and a full bestiary of monsters and beasts to fight in the wild. Intuitive combat+magic systems that allow you to play the game basically any way you like help immerse you in the boots of Geralt. Want to pick up work as a monster Hunter and earn some Crowns? Done. Want to race horses or play a solid, unique card game (with hundreds of cards to collect in-game)? Also Done. There's a lot to do just in the base game across the fully realized continents in the open world. As of 23 hours into the base game, I'm still probably only a third of the way through the main story if I had to guess. The GOTY edition contains two expansions, both of which add an additional 20-30 hours to the game respectively. Even if you ran through all of the base story in this game+the base story of the expansions, you're looking at 100+ hours to complete this gorgeous game. If you're in the market for a great open world fantasy game with emphasis on being a Monster Hunter for money, pick this game up. This is probably one of the greatest bargains for your buck whether it's on sale or not.",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

194,Posted: July 25,72.6 hrs on record,"Somewhere over 50% of this game is just boring cut scenes, attempted to be enhanced by the fact that almost every cut scene has an ultra hot babe throwing her ♥♥♥♥ around wanting you to save the day, ironic considering the game gives a Dark ages vibe and everybody is poverty stricken from war or dying of some kind of disease.The combat system is kind of nice, but the controls and movement feel really sluggish, both on keyboard and xbox controller so the sense of achievment you get from mastering the combat system is outweighed by the annoyance you constantly receive when your character moves in the wrong direction.The looting system feels really cheap, once again there isn't much sense of achievment when you loot chests because more or less everything you find in the world is junk and is sold for scraps, just that you end up collecting a tonne of it to make a fortune in this game.The character leveling leaves something to be desired as well, you get one attribute point when you level up and that's it, plus the fact that there is nothing really on offer, no rogue/stealth like skills to unlock or much in the way of archery, the crossbow is the biggest piece of crap, dealing about 10 damage when your swords are dealing 200+ so you never use it.The game starts to become a little bit grindy, pushing you into doing boring secondary quests or Witcher contracts, which are once again saturated with cut scenes that after a while of playing the game, I guarantee you will skip.All in all I bought this game expecting an RPG, and considering it's overwhelmingly positive reviews, a really good one at that, but was rather disappointed to find it's more of an adventure game, in an open world, and because I am constantly doing side quests to keep my character up to scratch I just can't really be engaged with the story.Since I got to Skellige I have had to push myself to continue this game and finish it.",5 people found this review helpful,Not Recommended

Forget about scoya'tael. And every time, when you find something good - some idiotic and stupid thing ruined impressions again and again.Game has ng+. Does the game have the potential to re-run?

Be prepared to catch that.There are minor glitches that just frustrate me beyond belief, but that's me being autistic about it and I should report it or something.

251,Posted: July 23,20.9 hrs on record,"First of all, I'm only describing the PC version here!I already had TW1 and TW2, but I still liked TW1 the best!First of all, the good thing about TW3 is of course the graphics. This is excellent. The sound, the music and everything else is also very harmonious. Of course the story is very good again.But that's where it stops! Already as in TW2 the controls are extremely console heavy and on the PC simply too jerky and bad (or simply ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t...). If you want to dodge, or run away, it can take 2-3 seconds until the character reacts at all. Also in combat this makes itself unpleasantly noticeable again and again. The combat is simply ♥♥♥♥!Even with objects, you often have to run back and forth before you can pick them up. I was already standing in front of torches that you couldn't light at all because you weren't standing in front of them absolutely correctly.Other games like TES (Skyrim) have already shown how to do this better, but the developers seem to have learned absolutely nothing from the past.I've been thinking a lot back and forth about whether to rate TW3 good or bad. But it will be probably a thumb down, because TW3 is (exactly like TW2) too console heavy and the conversion of the controls on PC and many other little things leave much to wish for!I really hope that the developers don't make the same mistake with ""Cyberpunk 2077"" and that this also becomes too console heavy (controls and the combat system, skills...)! Because I am especially looking forward to this game and if they hadn't learned anything new, it would be a big disappointment and for me the end for games from these developers!To the developers! Guys, there's more than just console games! Try harder with the PC conversion and not just such a half-hearted crap!",1 person found this review helpful,Not Recommended
252,Posted: July 23,69.6 hrs on record,Wanted to play the witcher games before cyberpunk 2077 so i bought wicther 3 goty edition last steam sale. After 56+ hours i will say a enjoyed it but only good thing i liked about it was the world and some grayness in the choices. Combat is kinda meh and they don't do much about the romance choices making them more of a checkbox then a part of the story that makes you want to fight for a plot/character. I think i will take a break before i play the dlc stories. Overall i was expecting alot more.,No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

256,Posted: July 23,178.3 hrs on record,"The Witcher III is hands down one of the best RPG's I ever played.From the get-go the game pulls you into its amazing world and deep story and doesn't let you go until the end.The world is vast and completely open, allowing you to roam wherever you want, including climbing, swimming, horse riding etc.What I loved about this world is that it feels 'alive'. People go around their daily business, seek shelter when it starts to rain, have day/night cycles etc.The music complements the scenery perfectly and really adds to the atmosphere, leading to an overal dark and gloomy feeling of a very harsh medieval world.Even as a simple level 1 character you actually mean something i.e. no ""Clear the cellar rats"" stuff, but meaningfull quests and proper monsters to hunt. The game brings everything what you could wish for as an RPG: extensive parts/ingredients, crafting on different levels, alchemy, durability loss, multiple skill tree options offering different ways to build your character etc.The story is sublime, provides different options/branches and is littered with meaningful characters which are all well fleshed out. Even the secondary quests have nice story points, background info etc which again brings the whole world to life.Add different romancing options into the mix and you get an amazing story! Here and there the devs also added some Easter Eggs with references to 'DLC', 'DRM', 'GOG' etc. I played the game on the 'Blood and Broken Bones' difficulty and had a blast. At the start it was tricky, but once I progressed further the scales tipped over to the easy side.For replayability there is a Game+ mode and also an option to have monsters scale with your level.All in all it took me 178 hrs to finish everything, including all DLC, reaching Level 52.Regarding expansions I found the 'Hearts of Stone' expansion so-so.It in essence boils down to one big quest and gave me a feeling like it was just pasted in to add Shani again as a romance option.In many cases Geralt acts completely out of character in this DLC up to a point where it became a bit annoying.Spoiler:For example, even the very end where Geralt takes the sword from Olgierd and thereby wounds Olgierd.This moment is purely there to show Olgierd is vulnerable, but it makes no sense at all from Geralt's point of view.A highly experienced Witcher, regarded as an expert in swordsman skills would never take a blade in such a rash way, causing an injury.The 'Blood and Wine' expansion on the other hand was a pure masterpiece!It adds a completely new area, full with new quests, new monsters, new everything.The environment of lively, sunny Toussaint is a huge contrast to the dark, foreboding Velen.This was for me the best endgame DLC I ever played. I'll never look at Fairy Tales in the same way again :DThe GOTY Edition still comes with a few issues, mainly some glitches with NPC's walking half into the ground etc.The controls can be fickle at times especially when trying to jump on/off something or when trying to move down a ladder.In the main game I also had a CTD from time to time (note that I'm using the HD Texture Mod so this could be related).The end verdict is an easy 11/10 for this one, it's a must have for any RPG fan!",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

The game is otherwise one of the best games i've ever played and dialogue options enable the story to be just a little different each time you play it making repeat playthroughs very worth your while to try different play styles and watch the story pan out in a new way.",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended
258,Posted: July 23,212.0 hrs on record,"And so, my journey finally ends...   After 200+ hours, which stretched over the course of 4 years, I've finally beat the Witcher 3 (including two expansions).What can I say, it was one hell of a journey.First thing first, this is the type of game that you should play for the plot and characters. While the gameplay is serviceable, I wouldn't say that it's anything extraordinary. In fact, the gameplay is my one and only complain: When the developers first teased the game, they promised that ""you would be able to track down monsters, set traps for them and hunt them down"". To me, this sounded like some gameplay mechanic that you could do by yourself, independently. However, this is not like that. Monster hunting in The Witcher 3 is a process of going from Point A to Point B, using the Witcher Senses (detective mode, whatever), following red tracks to Point C where the monster or quest event is located. So yeah, it's entirely scripted. You don't do anything by yourself, everything is done by following quest markers. This can become repetitive and tedious. The only things that prevent this process from becoming boring are the plot and the characters that are involved in these quests.At first, I was disappointed by the lack of gameplay variety and player freedom (in gameplay at least). However, I started enjoying this game fully when I realized that it's better to take it as an interactive movie, rather then a role-playing game. You are not able to play your own Witcher. Instead, you play as a predefined Witcher with a branching, but predefined, story (and an interesting one at that!).Now, the story and characters are the selling points of this game. They are what keeps you hooked and pushing forward. The writing is clever, funny, and full of interesting situations with no black-and-white outcomes. If you are in any way interested in Dark Fantasy and/or Slavic mythology, you should definitely play this game (if there are still people that haven't done so yet).P.S. I still find the books to be better than the game. Not to give the game a disservice, it's a masterpiece, for sure. However, imagine that the books are EVEN BETTER. Seriously, they're that good. (And I know that the author doesn't like the games, but think of this: Steven King doesn't like Kubrick's ""The Shining"", but that doesn't stop it from being a cult classic, right?).",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

If you are a fan of single player action-dark fantasy games, you're in for a big surprise. If you happen to purchase this on a steam Summer/Winter sell, you will find yourself getting a bargain of a game. For the low cost of this product, you're given at least 100-200 hours of game play if you are a perfectionist like me. Steam achievements with no internet required playing gives user a unique experience. The Witcher 3 is literally the closest thing we will have to a Game of Thrones video game.

384,Posted: July 18,121.8 hrs on record,"A damn good RPG game if you ask me. Put 120 hours into it and I was playing on easy and pretty much only did the quests I came across, probably missed a bunch. There's loads of stuff to do in the open worlds though like destroying monster nests and riding in horse races and finding hidden treasure, lot of variety in the game and each quest you do feels unique, none of the game ever feels repetitive at all which is great. The combat is decent if you ask me, you got the sword attacks with the dodging and you have a crossbow, you can block and parry attacks, you have your witcher signs you can cast to give you an edge, bombs to throw, oils to apply to your blades, perks that give you extra combat skills and so on. Quite a damn good game if you ask me, and you could definitely replay it a couple times and choose different options and different perks and stuff. Story is pretty darn good too, some of the voice acting of random npcs and stuff is so-so but aside from that not really many problems there.Since it is an open world game though its definitely got its fair share of bugs, enemies and other npcs stuck in walls, npcs not appearing correctly in cutscenes, things being stuck on the minimap, the cursor being stuck on the screen, objects in the world floating, had a crash or two here and there also and that's just what I remember, there were so many other bugs and glitches here and there, and people say Skyrim is buggy well Witcher 3 might not be far off, but most of the time the bugs don't really get in the way so its not so bad. Some other issues with the game though I feel like the character movement is clunky, definitely more apparent the longer you play the game, I guess the devs wanted to make it feel more smooth and realistic but just makes it more annoying to move around and its apparent when swimming too and riding your horse it can also be a pain. Another big issue with the game I think is randomly it uses up a load of CPU and just sticks like that until you restart the game, not very fun if you ask me, hearing my computer going crazy while trying to listen to a cutscene is a bit annoying, but if you have good cooling I imagine its not as bad. The graphics overall are pretty darn good, some clipping here and there which is a bit offputting but the rest is fine, the hair physics sometimes lowers the framerate a bit if you're indoors and the camera goes up to Geralt's head. But yeah aside from that not many other issues. The Hearts of Stone expansion was pretty cool, good little story and that, probably a good 20 hours of content at least. Blood and Wine was pretty good also, especially since you get an entire new map to play around in, story missions were great and let me tell you they're not kidding about the title, there is an insane amount of both blood and wine. But yeah overall a pretty damn good game, worth playing at least once. 8.5/10",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

For those that don't care for a smattering of softcore porn here and there in their games, you have been alerted to it's presence.  I can't recommend this game enough for those people that love a good story.  Be prepared though, it can be an emotional rollercoaster ride as you immerse yourself into the story, backdrop, and the huge variety of characters within.Don't forget to get the DLC's as well, they can be stand-alone games in their own right.

Taking place seven years after Andrzej Sapkowski's eight-novel saga, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt enters a world where wars between patriots ravage the land, where mad kings unhinge upon the scent of sovereignty, where the occult and the disparate are greeted with burning pyres.Yet a fountain of worldbuilding and age-old lore is not all it has to offer. It has a dazzling open world of picturesque landscapes, bustling cities and humble hamlets filled with life, culture, and a story behind every nook and cranny; an ample array of authentic, thoughtfully-written characters each facing their own trials of griefs, sorrows, and triumphs; and an absorbing, deeply personal tale worthy of matching even the greatest fantasy epics. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is phenomenal; a modern classic and a stone-cold masterpiece that has deservedly - and unquestionably - earned its legendary status as one of the greatest video games of all time.-----[ Around 70-100 hours completion time, excluding DLC(s) ]",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

The Story: actually makes you feel immersed in the game, care about every important character, and makes you think twice about which dialogue choices you pick. It didnt take long for me to become attached to the lore of the world, characters, and story thus when the game was nearing a close i felt sad and even an empty pit in my stomach knowing that this would be Geralts last game. The Gameplay: although it is the weak point of the game I feel it gets the job done. during my second playthru i gained a better understanding on how to fight in the game and its really not a bad experience especially if you know how to upgrade your character that fits your unique play style. Understanding how to craft Oils/bombs make the gameplay more enjoyable and crafting good armor that has phat bonuses will help you in fights. The physics, gore, and slicing through enemies limbs is also another plus of the gameplay.The DLCs: Both DLCs are great just get the game of the year edition when its on saleSide Quests: 95% of the side quests ive taken part of are good mini storys that are usually unique from one another, the other 5% is just your average fetch quest RPG stuff. Witcher contracts can have interesting twits but some are just your run of the mill contract to get some extra cash. treasure hunts are treasure hunts ;)Graphics: For a game that came out in 2015 these graphics are legendary and i find myself looking and taking screenshots of a ton of scenery.PC Port: I have ♥♥♥♥ specs (AMD FX 8320 overclocked to 4.1GHz (the fx processor serves as a heater too lol), R9 380x, 12GB 1600 Ram) and this game runs at 35-42 fps on a mix of ultra and high settings... the port is good Verdict: If the Combat was better it would be close to a 10/10 but since its not imma give it a solid 9.2/10.P.S. Those who say the game is bad simply because of the combat are stupid hipsters. Fallout 3 had ♥♥♥♥ combat and the game was critically acclaimed by fans... nuff said",3 people found this review helpful,Recommended

453,Posted: July 15,99.7 hrs on record,"CD PROJEKT RED's The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, is by leaps and bounds the greatest game I've ever played. Not only is it's world vast, but its rich with characters to meet and things to do. Clocking in at an impressive 80 hours, I have managed to finish the main story and it's 2 dlc's, but that's just their stories alone. I still have plenty of things to see, side quests to do, contracts to complete. Also worth mentioning as of yet I haven't touched any of the games crafting mechanics.I'm not going to touch any of the story, or even give it a brief synopsis, as it's simply a must to experience for yourself. The world CDPR have depicted here is filled with locations and plenty of attention to detail all around. The world itself is gorgeous and looks visually stunning. I personally have become so incredibly invested into its story and lore that you can only believe how difficult it was when the time I was always dreading (that I'm sure many did too) was when it finally ended. The vast amounts of different personalities and characters you will meet in this game is fascinating, The quests themselves are always intriguing and sometimes you never know if the side quest you're about to take on will take 10 minutes of your time, or if it'll take 2 hours, as with this game you truly will never know. Time flies. I was only going to fetch some armor diagrams when next thing I know, I've been ticking off side-quests and suddenly here I am completing the final DLC, 5 hours down the line, at 5am.This game has been a breath of fresh air for me, in a time where I've found single player games almost a chore, and with an ever increasing backlog, I found it hard to ever see myself having the ability to finish something. Yet, after crossing that hurdle, I suddenly don't know how to feel because part of me didn't want to see Geralt's story end, and that's upsetting.It's obvious why this game deserves all the praise it gets, because the passion that has gone into this game is admirable in a time of corporate greed. This is a game that you can pick up for £14, including all it's DLC in a sale, regularly. That's obscene. This game is easily worth £50, and I'm glad I paid that for it as this company truly deserves all the support and plaudits they can get.It's one of those things you can only experience for yourself, and it's one that you only truly get the most out of if you sit down, immerse yourself and soak it in, in all of its glory.This game is beyond anything else I have ever played and it's become a precedent when it comes to determining how good I deem a game to be, which unfortunately will result in me being unsatisfied with a LOT of games. Truly Game Of The Year, every year, forever. Thank You CD PROJEKT RED.tl;drGreatest game ever made.",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

474,Posted: July 15,55.8 hrs on record,"I'm sorry. I do like this game. I had a great deal of graphically awesome moments in the 56 hours I played. It is a very high quality, true AAA production graphics and sound wise. The gameplay has good moments too....Otherwise, it's a boring snooze fest. The running from one NPC to the other, the bad crafting, the absolute weird amount of.....TRASH items that have no purpose, the completely tiring amount of dialogue all spoken by the very very monotone Geralt. The menu diving is bad, the skills/leveling is meh....I'm giving this a thumbs down. Just cuz everyone else has given it so many thumbs up. I think its due for an honest thumbs down.  There's a great deal about it, besides the high production quality of the tireless amounts of voice-overs and very good animations, that just....sucks. The movement is also a chore - you have to fight the game to go in a straight line and just kind of go with it....while you correct the camera. The magic is disappointing. It just is. The alchemy is...weird. You just need alcohol to recreate what you made before - it doesn't make any sense - you just meditate and if you have alcohol, everything gets re-created. I got my money out of it at 55 hours, and I just finally got past Valen and Novigrad. The graphics are like nothing you've ever seen. They are very good. Performance is very good on a 1060 6gb/32ram i7 - Zero complaints.  It's quality, well running and performing software. I really am not sad about my purchase. However, stepping off the bandwagon > This game is great in some ways, but lame in other ways. For sure. I puts me to sleep. Getting to 56 hours was a pretty sleepy chore except for a few cool characters along the way. It's a solid 8 in my opinion. The women in the game are soooo cardboard, but so is Geralt = stiff and monotone to a fault. It's a great deal on sale and one of those games that's rated so high, it's worth it to be in your library to at least try and you just might love it. I found I don't love it.

483,Posted: July 14,318.2 hrs on record,"I've invested over 300 hours in this game across all of the DLC, and I still haven't had enough of it. If you played and enjoyed Skyrim, you're going to love Witcher 3 even more, and that's not an exaggeration. The game play world is beautiful, and the attention to detail is shockingly amazing. All around you, especially in the towns and cities, are NPCs going about their business and doing things you'd actually expect people in the real world to be doing. Listening in on conversations or observing NPCs going about their 'lives' that have nothing do with any quest in the game adds a level of realism that I've just not seen before in another title. Kudos to CD Projekt Red on the Steam Best Environment Award 2018 - well deserved! The main stories and side quests are interesting, humorous at times, cover the full difficulty spectrum, and only occasionally seem like a grind. The character development is fantastic, with highly thought out back stories for the supporting cast. Honestly, when I finished the main game and prepared for the expansion packs, I was actually sad to learn that I wouldn't be seeing most of the main characters again. A++ recommendation. I can't wait for Witcher 4 to come out.",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

509,Posted: July 13,370.2 hrs on record,"Amazing, amazing game.There is no other videogame RPG out there that puts as much creativity in their quests as the Witcher series, especially with the Witcher 3.Everything feels right with this game: The magic of the world feels dangerous and mysterious; you get this overall feeling that anything could happen when dealing with it, as it would be in real life. It's definitely not ""tropey"" and generic like your typical RPG spell-slinging.Every quest is memorable and well thought out. Fetch quests are practically non-existent or they're presented in a way that you don't even realize you're doing one-- that's a great thing. To say the quests are creative is a vast understatement; the amount of detail the developers have put into them will blow your mind. You play the role of a monster hunter, but it's presented in a fresh way. Where most developers would just throw you straight into battle with these monsters no questions asked (something we've done time and time again), CDPR has taken a slightly different approach. Most monster hunting jobs start off with an investigation where you can interrogate locals or study ""crime scenes"" that provide a glimpse into the backstory and lore of the world. Often times you get choice on how these encounters play out. It really creates this atmosphere that the creatures who inhabit this world don't exist solely to be a digital nail the protagonist needs to hammer down. The ""enemies"" are interesting.The characters are interesting too; they're all put into remarkable situations throughout the game. Nothing is boring. Nothing is easily predictable, it's a thrill ride from beginning to end. CDPR has done a phenomenal job bringing their characters to life and even has fun with it at times.The world feels like a living, breathing place that still persists even after you turn the game off. The developers have put a massive amount of thought into every facet of their world, even on stuff most game devs don't think about or bother with. For instance, you get to see what the nobility does in their leisure time. You get to see the common people trying to piece their lives together after war has taken everything from them. You get a glimpse of what healthcare and hospitals are like in this world. You get pulled into the politics, conspiracies and business ventures of ambitious entrepreneurs and politicians. You get to see and perform alongside bards and theatre troupes.It's insane. But I could go on and on.If you play video games, you owe it to yourself to play the Witcher 3. It's truly a landmark game that has changed gaming as we know it, and for the better! Not like what microtransactions has done for the current state of gaming, but I digress...Play this game.

510,Posted: July 13,82.7 hrs on record,"Wow. This game absolutely shocked me. You can tell the devs put quite a bit of time in crafting an intricate plot, and it really shows. Even the side quests can be considered fully fleshed out stories, quite rare for games today. Furthermore, the content in this game will last you years. I'm around 50 hours in and I still have a long way to go; I haven't even touched the DLC yet. I can really see why people have 400+ hours in this game. However, I'm the type of person that can only play through a story once, so I envision that I will have around 100-140 hours. Still, that's quite a lot of time for just one playthrough. I did buy the game on sale, around $15 including the DLC, but I would have no problem with buying it for $60, not including the DLC, because that's how much fun I'm having.TL:DR- What are you waiting for?

You really feel like you're inside the game.Its main campaign is large and a lot of fun. The DLCs are works of art, and they bring much more play time to the table. Hearts of Stone is a little shorter than Blood and Wine, but the latter even brings an entire map (Toussaint) for you to journey.The game is very well optimized too.

I'd expected to be bored out of my mind and move on from it quick, and in the first couple of hours, I was bored and confused and overwhelmed by all this game has to offer. But god I have never been so happy to be so wrong in doubting this game.This game is absolutely amazing and a one of kind masterpiece. This game makes me feel dirty because I only paid $20 for it and the 2 dlc. I feel like I've ripped cd projekt red off, most good games these days are charging $60 plus more with dlc, costing over $100, but I paid a mere $20 for the whole bundle. I have nothing to compare this game to. I am so sad now that I've played through it because I know a game like this will probably never be made again. I'm just baffled by how beautiful Toussaint is in the blood and wine dlc and the depth and immersion I've felt throughout my first playthrough. This world is so alive. I can't tell you how many times I found myself in an inn or tavern looking behind me irl because I thought a family member was behind me. People interact with each other, a war is being fought, all while you exist and sit by. The game isn't centered around you, you are centered around the game and it just feels so real. This game is truly a mark on the industry and I really hope it will influence future games, as most companies tend to be going down an unwanted path with the idea that a game solely exists to make money. This game is a nice refresher of what games once were, before all this god awful greed and overcharging we see way too often today. This game takes me back to simpler times when a company made a game to tell a story, show you what they can do, and this game has a damn good story. I think everyone in the gaming industry needs to take a long, hard look at this game and admire it's impact, and learn from all the things it did right.If you are weary, like I was, to buy this game in 2019, just stop thinking about it.

552,Posted: July 12,125.9 hrs on record,"Well it's come that time again. I've completed the Witcher trilogy and its expansions and now I can finally put my foggy old thoughts to text bubble and write a review.This is a review for TW 3 and all of its expansions packs. I purchased this game for 519 baht, or the rough equivalent of 17 USD. At this price it is well worth it. I have few gripes with the Witcher 3. My first gripe may seem trivial but I preferred the graphical presentation of TW 2 over this one. Walking around a town in TW 2 felt more to scale. The ""world"" wasn't bigger, per se, but the things in it were. In TW 3 the world is much larger, but everything in it feels like dolls or action figures inside of a kid's hands. Walking up a mountain, for example, takes so little time. It would appear that mountain was more akin to a hill but that's just a small gripe. I understand the limitations of consoles maybe is a factor here. I get that the third person perspective is not just desired but practically necessary for consoles. My second gripe with TW 3 is that once again, the choices you made in TW and TW2 seems rather... inconsequential. I was particularly peeved that one character I spared in TW2 only made but a short appearance in TW3, basically to die in front of me without saying so much as a single word. How disappointing. My third gripe is that the earlier portions of the story are rather inconsequential and feel more like padding. I really do not like the ""chasing"" someone construct here, particularly since you'll be wanting to explore but at the same time, feel as though you should be looking for someone instead. That said, towards the end, much like in TW, the story really picks up and wows and pulls on the heart strings. As much as I felt the start was sluggish and slow, the ending made up for it so much so. I started to see how some of the choices I made impacted the characters. I do wish that there'd been more instances of this, but it was nice to see some of it. Finishing the main story I began to play the two expansion packs and both were excellent in my view. The story telling and characters in both were memorable and relatable and fun and, barring a couple characters in Blood and Wine, well acted. I guess I can't emphasize this enough, without the expansions, TW 3 would probably just be an above average game, but those two compact stories, and a new map, really round out the game and make it much more that it was. Combat worked, but wasn't terribly interesting to me. I was challenged a few times against some bosses. The final boss of Blood and Wine made me pull my hair out. But each were beatable, if a tad irritating to play against. I wish there's been more of a timing element to attacking, much like in the Witcher where you could time attacks to gain bonuses and string combos. I don't know why they got rid of that, as it at least took some skill to time attacks well. I do really like the variety of magic skills and how they let you express varying playstyles through your choices of progression there. Progression itself, though, was pretty damn slow. A level or two by itself never really seemed to give you much of a power spike. The most powerful progressions were the weapons and armor you could craft. Those seemed to really make a noticeable difference. In some ways, TW 3 is a perfect game. In some ways, I think there's still room to grow.

556,Posted: July 12,194.5 hrs on record,Best. Open. World. Game. Ever.The story of the game starts exactly after the end of the book series. Every little in-game fact concerning the past is totally accurate according to the books. So this masterpiece not only remains absolutely faithful to the books (except Triss' red hair) but also is giving you the opportunity to finish the series as you please. Even if you haven't played the two previous games (or read the books) you can still play and enjoy this game tremendously.,No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

561,Posted: July 12,52.0 hrs on record,"Рецензии принято писать на холодную голову, хорошенько все обдумав, переварив и взвесив. Однако же «Ведьмак 3» — особенная игра, поэтому и мы позволим себе особенное к ней отношение. Да и писать обзор на Witcher 3 без эмоций — все равно что пытаться вылезти из логова риггера чистеньким.Интриги уже явно не получится, поэтому начнем с главного: у поляков все получилось. То есть они не просто выпустили хорошую игру, а сделали почти невозможное: умудрились оправдать все возложенные на них ожидания, что в данном конкретном случае можно назвать не иначе как фантастикой. Дело в том, что ожидания были огромны. Публику разогрели до такой степени, что она видела в третьем «Ведьмаке» идеальную игру. Мы, кстати, тоже. В подобных случаях ожидания, как правило, натыкаются на суровую реальность, когда игра хороша, но воображение уже успело нарисовать нечто настолько восхитительное, с чем реальность конкурировать уже не в состоянии. Случается это, к сожалению, довольно часто. Здесь же произошло чудо: подобные ожидания не просто оправдываются, но и оказываются превзойдены потрясающей воображение реальность. Игра постоянно удивляет и показывает нечто новое, к чему мы готовы совершенно не были. Чудеса, да и только.Перед тем как в деталях рассказать о том, что в игре хорошего, давайте быстренько пройдемся по недостаткам, чтобы больше к ним не возвращаться. Их здесь, благо, совсем мало. Главный и, пожалуй, наиболее существенный минус «Ведьмака 3» — ломающееся оружие и броня. Серебряный меч тупится о монстров едва ли не быстрее, чем труба гнется о головы зомби в Dying Light. Из-за этого нам постоянно нужно бегать к кузнецу как на работу, что порядком раздражает. Можно, конечно, таскать с собой ремонтные наборы или парочку запасных клинков (всего получается четыре штуки, что довольно забавно), но все это — дополнительный вес, а значит меньше трофеев из странствий. Эту функцию сильно хочется отключить и никогда к ней не возвращаться.Также задания по выслеживанию жертвы или поиску следов могут немного утомить, хотя тут у Геральта есть одно железное оправдание: он ведьмак и работа у него такая. Есть претензия и к локализации: порой персонажи начинают тараторить с такой скоростью, что невольно задаешься вопросом, сколько скороговорок они проговаривают по утрам. Завершает этот короткий список изъянов камера, которая ведет себя абсолютно адекватно во всех ситуациях, кроме кулачных боев. В эти моменты она почему-то норовит показывать что угодно, только не противника. Камера в кулачных боях… чувствуете размах? То-то и оно. На этом недостатки у игры заканчиваются.А вот достоинства здесь можно перечислять довольно долго, чем мы, собственно, и займемся. Рассказывать о сюжете особого смысла нет — лучше самим все увидеть. Освежим в вашей памяти лишь основные моменты. Нильфгаард наступает на разрозненные Королевства Севера, делая то, чем обычно и занимается большинство армий — грабит, жжет и убивает. Север же сплотился под началом Родовида Реданского, прозванного Свирепым, которого назвали так неслучайно: из-за своей ненависти к чародейкам он искореняет всех, кто хотя бы косвенно связан с магией. Дым от сжигаемых на кострах магов дает понять всем сомневающимся, что на отважного защитника угнетенных он тоже совсем не похож.В этой-то атмосфере всеобщего безумия, хаоса, голода и войны Геральт пытается найти свою названную дочь — Цири. На этом пути ему повстречаются как персонажи, знакомые по предыдущим играм, так и те, кто раньше встречался лишь в книгах. Йеннифер, император Эмгыр, генералы Дикой Охоты и еще масса интересных личностей.Здесь стоит сказать, что сценаристы проделали просто потрясающую работу. Каждый герой проработан настолько хорошо, что ни на секунду не сомневаешься ни в его мотивах, ни в реализме происходящего вовсе. Нечто подобное раньше мы видели, пожалуй, лишь в играхBiowareдаGTA 5. Все взаимодействуют друг с другом и ведут себя словно живые. Каждый имеет свой характер, мотивы и особенности, благодаря чему к героям можно как искренне привязаться, так и не менее искренне их возненавидеть. В отдельных случаях есть даже вполне ощутимый шанс всплакнуть. Кстати об играх Bioware: в определенные моментыWitсher 3удивительно напоминаетMass Effect. Тут заставляют вспомнить и знаменитую «Самоубийственную миссию» и трогательный финал из «Цитадели» и набор из уцелевших персонажей, прошедших с игроком через всю серию.CD Projekt, впрочем, все это подает по-своему, поэтому в плагиате студию никак не обвинишь.емалую роль играет и повествование, которое практически лишено популярных сюжетных штампов. В кино, и тем более в играх, нас приучили к тому, что мы примерно знаем, где будет кульминация, где проникновенный диалог, а где философская беседа. В жизни же все это совершенно непредсказуемо из-за совокупности случайностей. Здесь точно также. Задание может внезапно прерваться, дополниться, потерять актуальность, а то, что, как казалось, должно было стать кульминацией, может внезапно повернуться самым неожиданным образом. Из-за этого в историю действительно веришь и следишь за ней крайне внимательно.А какие красивые истории умеет рассказывать CD Projekt! Помните ту сцену в эльфских купальнях из второй части? Так вот здесь таких сразу несколько, причем никогда нет и намека на повторение. Истории могут быть романтические, печальные или смешные — все получаются просто великолепно. Причем хороши здесь не только сами истории, но и фон, который для них выбран. Представьте, когда разговор о любви происходит на вершине горы, с которой открывается потрясающий вид, а на фоне играет красивая музыка. Нужно быть просто бесчувственной стрыгой, чтобы не проникнуться моментом. Таких мелочей в этой игре бесконечное множество. Нет ни случайных ракурсов, ни мелодий, ни задних планов.",3 people found this review helpful,Recommended

In fact, this will probably be one of the only games where I actually explore every corner of the map and complete every quest.

579,Posted: July 11,35.9 hrs on record,"I am not going to lie, I am not a huge fan of this game genre, I am mostly into games like Insurgency and ARMA, but I saw the GOTY edition of this game for £12 which is a bargain, so I bought it (I have to admit, I was influenced by the reviews and mostly by my mates)Since I don't really like this type of games, I just skipped through the dialogue in the beginning of the game, as I expected it to be cringey, with crappy voice-acting, and lifeless characters.  OH BOY WAS I WRONG  I also thought that the graphics, although pretty, were a bit washed-out.As I got deeper into the game (3-4 hours in) I just got hooked. I installed a few mods (graphical and gameplay) and I haven't stopped playing the game for the past 2 days, racking up 30 hours (I wish I was joking).I don't really do side-quests, and I am almost at the end of the game (reckon I will finish in 20 more hours) and the pure amount of decisions that are important is amazing. They are  hard  decisions, and I like how the developers allow me to stare at a screen for 2 hours only to  decide if I want to ask Triss to stay or not at the end, or decide if I should tell Yennefer that I still love her after talking to the Djinn The music is breathtaking, I can honestly compare it to the Last of Us in terms of how much it adds to the atmosphere. Speaking of atmosphere, there are several times when shivers went down my spine  such as when you talk to the Wood Ladies through the Baron's wife and the music and their demonic voices just make you think of how you are going to fulfil their task. The same can be said for the druid Tree, as it is begging you for mercy while you are killing it  I can't wait to play the two expansions and then complete the game again and again. I am honestly baffled as to how good a game could be. I can 100% say that The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and The Last of Us are the only games which made me want to smack myself with a bat in the head to lose my memory, only to experience them again for the first time.Good job CD Projekt Red, you deserve all the praise.",1 person found this review helpful,Recommended

593,Posted: July 11,131.5 hrs on record,"Witcher 3 is definetely worth playing and all the time you spend on it. However, sometimes (in fact, quite rarely) certain aspects of the game, combat for example, might be sort of either frustrating or even infuriating, yet, as mentioned,this happens rarely, might estimate with 2 or 3 times during the playthrough. Game offers a plenty of high quality sidequest and you can easly notice that even minor sidequests are carefully handmade making them worth completing. Main story might be a little bit slow paced at the beginning (depends on how you play though) but becomes interesting and even intriguing closer to the second third of it. Gameplay is generally great, satisfying and doesn't get boring at any point. Despite being quite long (about 100+ hours of the content) , game doesn't build grindwalls in its intirety which is obviously a good thing since you have more freedom. DLC's are very well done and ""Blood and Wine"" is probably the most valuable DLC made at the current state of industry. Expansions' subplots are made even better than in original game and for me personally, ""Blood and Wine""s story was more interesting and the way more touching than the original game's one.

631,Posted: July 10,219.1 hrs on record,"This game is Legendary. An epic conclusion of the journey of Geralt of Rivia. I don't need to say anything. This game has it's own reputation. Not only GOTY can also count as the game of the decades or even century.  Optimization is damn so good.  If you haven't played Witcher 1 and 2 then don't play 3. You must finish 1 and 2 first then play wild hunt or else you won't understand a thing. The story varies on your choices. Your choice will lead to different endings. So craft your own path as you seem fit. Background music is damn awesome. If you are thinking to buy this then don't waste your time by thinking BUY ITEven if you buy this game with it's full price you won't regret. It's totally worthy. So far so good...will give a full review when finished the game 100%  FINALLY  After 217Hours of gameplay finished the game 100%, did every side quest, discovered every location, got every grandmaster armor.

653,Posted: July 9,240.0 hrs on record,"It is a little bit late for a review, considering the game is 4 years old by now. Starting with a TL;DR. It absolutely is worth the investment.   There is no way to deny its positives aspects.   Aesthetically, it is downright stunning: impecable lighting, intricately detailed textures, lush forests, vibrant colors, complex weather patterns, and very vivid sounds. The world seems very much alive.    Gameplay-wise this game has everything you could wish for in an open-world RPG. You are free from the very first minute of gameplay and the are only loose recommendations of what you should do next. Of course there's is the overarching story guiding you towards a specific end, but you're not constrained by it. The game has a set of specific checkpoints, specific missions, or quests, where you must arrive. Between these checkpoints ( missions ) you have complete freedom. This freedom however makes it difficult for the game to account for every single path, and sometimes you will feel railroaded into a cutscene that makes no sense in your playthrough because you took a different path toward said checkpoint. But this is a minor issue.   Where the game does not shine so brightly, however, is in writing, and most worringly in acting, or voice-acting. The universe they have created is interesting and full of life, but the story is not very engaging. I attribute this to the challenge of creating a plot to guide the player, but also leaving it open-ended enough to allow the player free-will. The more glaring issue, however, is in character writing. Most characters have stiff dialogue, which is made even worse by the below average voice-acting most characters have. Geralt's voice-acting sounds like a caricature, like Christian Bale's batman. Go on youtube and listen to Geralt's voice actor speak and draw your own conclusions. Most accents sound silly and forced. Every single instance, in which I had my suspension of disbelief broken was because of cringeworthy dialogue lines delivered in a mediocre maner. Now CDPR is a relatively small studio and voice-acting can gobble up a large piece of budget, so it is understandable.   Regarding gameplay mechanics, this game is very solid. There are minor issues with automatic targeting and key registration at times. But even on the highest difficulty it will not be a big issue. User interface, specifically inventory, has seen upgrades since launch but still is one of the games greatest shortcommings in this area.    There is nothing to complaint in matters content. CDPR claim you can finish the game in anything between 25 and 75 hours. It took me 150 hours to finish the base game, no expansions. And one of the expansions, Blood and Wine, is as big as a standalone game. It clearly is more than a bargain considering the price.   Despite my complaints this game is amazing. I do not want to ""hate on it"", but I do believe in sharing my experience and thoughts. And I will be replaying all 150 hours of base game plus however many DLC hours. I am glad I found this game after I was disappointed by the ME:Andromeda fiasco.",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

659,Posted: July 9,98.2 hrs on record,"Main Game: The Witcher 3 is a very big and fun game which is breathtaking. There are many quests and items alongside a heap of interesting characters. The game puts a dark spin on many child stories like ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarves"" and many more. The game is not too long or too short but when you do finish it you also want to dig into the DLC as quick as possible. There are many locations which are similar but unique in their own ways. This is hard to pull off but CD Projekt Red pulled off. I definitely recommend the base game but i would strongly advise to buy the DLC.Hearts of Stone:I personally feel this DLC is underwhelming. It introduces new quests along with new characters and monsters but does not include a new location. This is going to be a very small spoiler but nonetheless  at the start of the DLC you kill the prince and are taken buy soldiers from Ofir, you then are taken to a ship but break out and is left on a beach to fight. I half expected we would be able to explore Ofir but I was left disappointed . This is my only downside of the DLC you do get to see new place within ""The Northern Kingdoms"". The quests are fun and engaging and you see "" an old friend "" you need to use your head to solve riddles if you take a certain path.Blood and Wine:This DLC is the best DLC i have ever played in any game. The setting of a magical and fairy-tale Toussaint. The landscape is amazing and very colourful. The quests are very interesting and I really enjoy the Vampire theme of the DLC. The characters you meet live up to the stories of medieval knights and common folk. You can uncover some ""skeletons in closets"" of some people. I really recommend this DLC. It is hard for me to describe it so just play it and see for yourself how amazing and almost nostalgic the DLC is.",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

680,Posted: July 9,130.8 hrs on record,"34 hours in when writing this review. I played these 34 hours in 3 days. That means 80 to 100 % of my awake time was spent on playing this. I think I may completed 1% of the game. And I have maybe completed 10% of the story. That or less. I am one of those people that believe this game is a masterpiece. I can't explain the exact reason because I don't know.Take it from someone who usually does not like open world RPGs (skyrim, fallout, dying light, dead island, prototype, state of decay, shadow of mordor, watch dogs, AC 3 onwards, any far cry other than 3rd, <-- I haven't finished any of these games, I couldn't), because I usually drown in their content. There will be so much to do in those games that I will even forget the story sometimes, or see their side content as ""work that needs to be done"" which puts me off. I get confused and I don't have any fun. God dammit I hate open world RPGs.Not this game. It doesn't drown you, it doesn't throw content at you if you don't want it to. You can just play the story, or you can just dive into the open world. You can do both. You gotta just let the game come to you. And like I said, although the world is massively massive, it doesn't drown you. Don't see the world map as several hundred hours worth of ♥♥♥♥ that needs to be done. Just play it at your pace. If you feel tired and fed up from quests, don't say one more quest, turn the game off and come back tomorrow.This should be the new standard for RPG games. I would probably rate this game 10/10.

682,Posted: July 9,98.3 hrs on record,"My view of this game changed drastically while i was getting sucked deeper and deeper in to the story against all the odds of me not liking this kind of genre.At start of the game i didn't really hesitate to skip all the dialog, i wasn't interested to it at that point. Graphics looked little washed out and soft, and none of the characters seemed interesting. I just wanted to get this game over with, throw in couple hours and uninstall it. I did not know what was ahead of me, possibly a new title to my list of favorite games of all time.Once i was finished with few main quests i started to actually listen what was happening around me, dialogs weren't so gringy and bland as i was expecting it to be, went further in to the story and i was suddenly hooked.Combat. Sword fight was not something i was happy to spend time on, and this game is great at giving me option to just skip almost every fight and rather keep chasing the story that i am so in to. Example of the opposite: I have played games that just cant stop shoving enemies in front of your path, and you have no other option than confront to advance, well this isn't one of them, which is great, for me at least.Graphics. I run RTX2070 so i have no problems running at 1440p max settings, but still, i truly started to respect the visual side of the game only after i turned anti-aliasing off and pumped up sharpness. For most games this would destroy the look of it, but for this, it actually brought to light the vast amount of small details in the world, so much so that it changed the experience entirely.World. Once again, me and my low expectations were waiting for a procedural copy-paste land with no depth to it, and well even when it technically is, Wild Hunt managed to make best of it with its forest-like surroundings. And the key features of making it work was because vegetation is packed more dense and variations in land structure are much more realistic. Basically, its not flat and you actually feel like being somewhere unique and this makes travelling from point A to B much more interesting and you wont skip travelling so often even given the chance to do so.This review has been written after 35 hours in to it. And ill be certain that if this game keeps delivering until the end, it might just end up to my top 5 games and opens me a whole new game genre to take seriously.",35 people found this review helpful1 person found this review funny,Recommended

Has an old world feel.  Geralt's scars and pain have substance.  The decisions you make actually matter.  The dialogue is fantastic in most of the scenes with particular emphasis to the Witchers' drinking scene.  Get the extra content.  Graphics are sick.  Magic impact to the environment is truly a wonder.  Finally there are so many amazing easter eggs in this game, it is unreal.

As everyone already knows the story telling, writing, world building, combat, side quests and all expansions are complete masterpieces that no game has matched since it's release. I thought the Witcher 3 couldn't get any better till I experienced a slick 60 fps on ultra, this alone adds so much to the experience and makes the already masterfully crafted world that much better. Anyone who's played this on PS4 or Xbox and has/plans to use a PC this is a must buy for another playthrough.

755,Posted: July 8,273.4 hrs on record,"Playing this game in 2019 was the best decision I had made this year. Not only do you play as a witcher, you get to feel what it's like to BE a witcher . Especially on the hardest difficulty, Death March, because it's essential to use oils, bombs and signs, and utilize them as much as possible. Mind you, I have played this game on console before (not as much though) and the reason I didn't continue playing it because of how much I was overwhelmed by how big this game is. Also, because I didn't have time, really. So, I decided to take advantage of my summer break and dedicate my time entirely to this game. Since this game is very popular and I'm sure by now everyone and their mother knows TW3, I'm just going to get too detailed.Story: If you really want the best story experience, start playing from the first Witcher game in the trilogy. But as for the Witcher 3, the story is simple; nothing very unique, innovative or unseen before. Plain simple. The best stories you'll get are the secondary quests. They are the best I've seen in any RPG game. Not only are they so interesting, even the littlest of side quests can have a huge impact. YOU choose what you want Geralt to be. For example, do you want Geralt to be a heartless witcher who would do anything for gold, or do you want Geralt to be a witcher who sets boundaries between what's right and what's wrong. There aren't really ""good choices"" in this game, as they all have consequences regardless what you choose. (In the main quest however, it's kinda of a different matter in that regard.)Gameplay:Very fun and quite unique, however the combat and out of-combat movement can get very wonky sometimes. For instance, Geralt can get stuck in tiny obstacles like little boxes (especially during combat).Unlike other games, the enemies in this game won't wait for their buddies to finish attacking Geralt - They WILL attack Geralt simultaneously. Which is a good thing, imo. Alchemy is very innovative in my opinion. It's so in-depth. Mainly because of the crafting/dismantling system. It will definitely overwhelm you at first, but you can get the hang of it pretty quick. Especially once you figure out that you don't have to craft oils or potions more than once xD. Gwent - a very fun, yet simple card mini-game that you can play with random merchants, blacksmiths, armorers, blacksmiths, etc. to collect sets of Gwent cards.Geralt's horse, Roach, yeah F**CK THAT C*NT! You summon him, only to find him spawned on THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DAMN MAP.Graphics:This game came out in 2015... I'm astonished by how much detail CDPR had pit into this game. How much love and passion. It feels like it came out yesterday. Most sequels in games get worse as they progress, but every Witcher game CDPR had out out is better than the other, and you can see how much they have improved over the years.Conclusion:IT'S NEVeR TOO LATE TO PLAY IT. For those who are hesitant to give this game a shot, I say go for it. You won't regret it!",1 person found this review helpful,Recommended

764,Posted: July 8,22.9 hrs on record,- When you start the game and get into the prologue it seems the story is intriguing. After a while you realize it's repetitive.- One big negative thing about the game is the bad movement controls. How you move the character and the horse. And yes I play with a controller. The movements seems floaty.- The combat is boring and doesn't feel satisfying. - This game is not a sandbox RPG if you thought so. You follow a linear story. I know you can just go around and do sidequests and explorer the map. Eventually you have to follow the story. If you like a story driven game with a lot of dialogue then this game is for you. If you are looking for something like Dark Souls then this isn't for you.,2 people found this review helpful2 people found this review funny,Not Recommended

802,Posted: July 7,262.4 hrs on record,"This game rivals my all time favorite single player game--Fallout New Vegas--and just about wins. The Witcher 3 is home to THE best storytelling and character developments of any game I know. It's a truly and beautiful masterpiece with great mechanics, characters, story, weapons, armor, RPG elements, mods, and more. I really can't say anything else without repeating myself.Though from my enjoyment of playing this game I also played the first two which are also worth it but not even comparable to this one. I've even started reading the book series the games were based off of since I can't get enough of the Witcher universe. One last thing is the amazing DLC's this game provides, the Blood and Wine DLC is unmatched in every aspect and is loved for how it sums up the Witcher's path for good, in the games true, and final ending.Overall9.8/10-Z, VI",2 people found this review helpful,Recommended

808,Posted: July 7,75.2 hrs on record,"A Triumph This game has been a phenomenal experience and truly deserves the hype and praise that it receives. For me personally, I could not get into the first two Witcher games, and was hesitant to buy the third. That being said,  Your opinions of the first two games should not hold you from picking this gem up.  The story is an all time best and the game immerses you in it like no other. The game of the year addition is a must buy, and is a no brainer if it is on sale. My only qualm regarding this game is the horse riding as it is rather clunky. However, the combat system in this game is bad ♥♥♥. It makes you truly feel like the mighty Garult of Rivia. Overall: 10/10",1 person found this review helpful,Recommended

Think of it as a newer Skyrim, per se. Same style of game, but a completely new world that you can feel truly immersed in.

Unlike other Open World I enjoyed exploring every Area and collect all the stuff you can get ( ok tbh I didnt liked the skellige design but it is still awesome). There were only 3 things that really bothered me- the pathing of your horse sometimes is so ♥♥♥♥ that i rather chose to walk the whole way- swiming and diving controls weren*t really enjoyable- the german voice was a lot of times very weird, either it didn*t sound like the person should sound or you can hear kinda a bathroom kinda room sound if you know what i mean. Also the show from Priscilla was aweful it was literally a pain to listen. It sounded like every single line was recorded seperatly because it just stopped and the next line began. The voice of Geralt on the Blood and Wine addon sounded like the German voiceacter was Ill or something.Tbh I dont really know where to start and when to end. I absolutly enjoyed the Campaign and will check out the Addons and start a new game +.I would give the game 9.8/10",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

933,Posted: July 7,64.0 hrs on record,"I've played a lot of games in my time, and I'll say this straight away before I say anything else, I'm not a massive fan of RPG games. Something about a lot of them just don't interest me in the slightest, albeit there are some exceptions.However, The Witcher 3 is an absolute masterpiece, I had tried to play the game a long time ago and really did not enjoy the first part of the game while you're in the White Orchard, after that part though, the game kicks off. I have never been as engaged or enjoyed a game as much as this one, in fact, I'll say it's one of the best games I've ever played, almost everything about it feels so perfectly crafted, so much passion put into it. If you're a fan of immersive story telling, definitely try this if you haven't already.",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

971,Posted: July 7,102.0 hrs on record,"Quite simply once of the best franchises going and this game is one of few that I will be playing from scratch again. The witcher 3 is one of my favourite games of all time, and a game whose dlc does not let it down either, these provide some seriously great content that is well worth getting, you will find so much to do in the world that you will be playing for hours on end. It's also a world that doesn't feel empty, the day/night cycle changes the landscape drastically and so is always changing. Both the books and the games provide amazing storylines and characters and you will not regret getting this game.I'd recommend playing 1 and 2 before but you don't have to if you don't want to.",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended
