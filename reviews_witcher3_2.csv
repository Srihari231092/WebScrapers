0,Posted: July 6,115.0 hrs on record,"After completing the entire main storyline and all of the DLC questlines as well as all the secondary quests save for the treasure hunts, I can confidently say that this game has found its way into my personal hall of fame. Even though the game came out several years ago, it still had a grasp of the genre that felt novel to me, and was in many ways quite refreshing. I personally lean towards open world, rpg games like the ghost recon series, assassins creed, borderlands, and far cry, but this game gave me a story that, even though i hadn't played the previous installments, felt personal, just because of the depth of the story, and just how much it sucked me up. Nothing really felt like it was just extra material, everything felt rather fleshed out and as though the developers had paid attention to even the smaller details, the little quests. In an era of games where we have big corporations like EA skimping on the underrated smaller details, it really makes me hopeful to find a relatively big company willing to spend the time and money to make a game more than a game, but a piece of art. This is my first review ever, so I'm just writing my personal feelings. It isn't super objective, but I think this game is a joy for fans of the genre, and also easy to pick up for newcomers. I rate 9/10.",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

18,Posted: July 6,104.2 hrs on record,"Even after all this time, you'd be hard pressed to find a more immersive and engaging single player title that takes place in a fantasy based setting. Bought a PC copy on impulse because of the deep discount from the steam summer sale, and it hasn't struggled to live up to my memories of it in the slightest. The combat controls are as crap as on the previous Witcher titles, but that's to be expected. They've always played better on a controller. Still, once you get past the controls there isn't a game out there that presents a more meaningful open world experience. P.S. I only wrote this to chase an achievement, and try to distract myself for the impending heat death of the universe.",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

Epic storyline with choices that play a part later in the game.There is so much to do and discover, which in my case is both good and bad because i can't really progress to the next area/country before i've discovered them all, and done all side-quests and witcher contracts.... The bags get a bit clustered sometimes and i find the crafting a bit messy. But it gets easy enough to manage after a few times not doing quite what you wanted.Overall a great game and one of my favorites!",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

279,Posted: July 6,136.6 hrs on record,"What do you think first when it comes to the Polska!!? For many people, it could be a talented musician Chopin or a famous chemist and physicist Maria Curie.But for us , or even Former President Barrack Obama, when it comes to Poland, The Witcher series is the name cannot be ignored. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt not only has outstanding gameplay and superb storyline, but also has ""top of the line"" graphic at that time, with a series of extremely eye-catching visual effects.The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt not only attracts players to the main storyline, but also attracts them to small details, side quests with various ""tactics"". It can be high-cut scenes, or dialogue that requires players to learn, think and make their own judgments and choices.It could also be a decadent setting with mourning game characters who are beside the relatives who are in danger, short stories of mystery that are contained in pieces of paper, a book on the roadside .Besides those wonderful things, the game still suffers on some annoying bugs. Fortunately, these errors are only really annoying if you are really the most difficult player. The AI sometime is not so great, sometimes it's very dull. The most obvious thing is that Geralt only needs to get out of the land where the enemy is guarding a little bit, and now they are completely ... not chasing after. All we need to do is just shooting or using long-range magic to destroy the enemy easily without fear of being countered.All in all, this's a great game that worth every cent in your pocket.",1 person found this review helpful,Recommended

The Witcher 3 is the last game of the Witcher series a bast game with a least 60h of play.

I mean, the story, the gameplay and characters and everything about it is just impressive...you could get lost from countless hours of game time playing this once you dive deeper into the game. it does start off a bit dull and boring in the beginning but later on it gets better once you keep at it. there are TONS of things to do to keep you busy for awhile from doing contact missions to earn a bit of gold on the side if you want, to side missions plus TONS of places to go and explore. and the map is huge.. like overwhelmingly huge... it is for me atleast. every attention to detail is truely remarkable, as well as the voice acting (in my opinion) and the combat, while not the best in the world... is really fun and satisfying (In my opinion). I'd go on forever about this game, but then this review would get rather long so I'll end it here.. so far this game has became my top favorite to play and I can't wait to check out cyberpunk2077 <3",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

I've bought the game before and I'll admit, I didn't enjoy it, so i refunded it, and upon the next summer sale, I decided to give it another chance after a friend's recommendation. For those of you who are making this their entry to the series, like me, you may not enjoy it off the bat, and understandably so, the first couple hours in the first area are admittedly quite slow and may turn you off. I was told to stick through the area and move on to the next, and thank the lord I did. The game's options really open up, and with an insurmountable pile of content to enjoy, there is bound to be something that you'll enjoy. The combat is fun, the crafting, weapons and armour are fun to collect and experiment with, the variety of beasts to fight are insane. Overall, fantastic game, definitely recommend.",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

 Before now this would not be a game i would play........... Although I have become addicted to it. I love the story behind it and the questing. If you want to play a game that you basically loose time in and enjoy playing this is the game for you. My only cons is that the game crashes and at times you get stuck on a boat. Make sure to save often and then just log out and back in and its fixed. I would highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys playing story based games. At first this game scared me so it took me 3 years to play it. I tried to set up the controls and i got overwhelmed because im not good at remembering a lot of controls. But when i got brave and figured it out iv already got 100+ hours in this game and cant wait to be able to play it.",1 person found this review helpful,Recommended

I'm sure cutting two words out of every sentence is some kind of aesthetic choice or faithful carryover from Polish but it just makes him seem really basic.Other than those things though, I really cant find anything to be disappointed with.

575,Posted: July 5,103.1 hrs on record,"This is an excellent game for any fan of the fantasy genre, whether you are familiar with The WItcher or not.The only complaint I have is that the combat can get dull by the end of your play through of the game. The character leveling and upgrading of skills can grow stagnant. Meaning once you have your favorite abilities leveled up and completely enhanced with equipable items and what not, you'll find yourself rotating between a few abilities and doing the same thing over and over again because it is the most effective. This gives the choice of sticking to what you have upgraded and possible get a little bored of the play style you have chosen, or forcing yourself to adapt to another style of play that you do not have upgraded which can be tasking when taking on challenges at your current, higher level. That short sweet embrace of the unfamiliar will not last very long, you will still be doing the same few abilities in no time. But, these are just very picky gripes that I come up with because everything else the game has to offer is fantastic. The presentation, the acting skills at play from the talent behind the characters, the choices the player is tasked with making feel impactful and gives you a sense of agency within the world. No one thing is really ""pointless"" in this game and everything you see that you can interact with has a purpose in one way or another. This is truly a standard in gaming that has been set, but not often is reached by other studios. Excellent work by CD Projekt Red.This is very much worth spending your money on.",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

581,Posted: July 5,31.8 hrs on record,"I don't understand why this game has such a good rating. The combat is so clunky it's basically unplayable. I'm playing on the lowest difficulty (Just story) and I still have hard time to kill anything. And no, I'm not killing high level enemies, rats level 4 shouldn't be tough and eat 80% of my health bar. The movement and targeting system is so weird, the camera spinning around, Gerald jumping at random directions. Often he just decides to sheathe his weapon and fight bare hands. And let's pretend that fighting on horse back is not in the game.The only reason I've been trying to play this game is the story. I read all books and I'm curious what happened after. And from the tutorial area the story looks promising. But man, the combat drives me crazy and I always quit the game in rage because it's the worst and clunkiest combat I've ever seen (and I've seen a lot).",No one has rated this review as helpful yet1 person found this review funny,Not Recommended

618,Posted: July 5,72.3 hrs on record,"While I do recommend this game it is not for everyone. The story is beautiful, the combat is a bit weird sometimes and many times it will give you an unsettling feeling (the atmosphere not the combat). I finished quite a few times the game and now I found myself buying it with every DLC again. There is a certain thing that makes someone come back to it and I really can't describe it. At this point I can put among my favorite games.There are people which review it as a bad game. I do understand that the story is not for everyone, some people would prefer ""better combat"" and might find many other stupid reasons. If you don't personally like a game don't buy it. If you don't enjoy it after you got it, it's your problem. The developers made such a great game and I don't see why should some people simply ignore all the effort they've put in it.In the end the game has very good graphics. Lower end PCs can handle it without much effort though not on ultra graphics. The combat is interesting as you have to prepare for most of the encounters and you can find clues about what to do or where to go from random npc chatter.I will rate it 10/10 even with the few bugs that might occur during the gameplay.

The combat is clunky and repetitive, the characters are unlikable and boring.

Geralt's voice acting made me want to refund the game after the first cut scene, but who's counting anyways. The game can't run above 20 fps after just 10 min of game play and here are my computers specs: 2.8-GHz Intel Core i7-7700HQ CPU, an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 GPU with 3GB of VRAM, 16GB of RAM and a 512GB NVMe SSD.

716,Posted: July 5,7.1 hrs on record,"So as you can see from this review I didn't played much but I played enough to feel confident to leave this review in both simplified and complex forms. I bought this game for 8,99 euros during 2019 summer sales and if I knew how good this game is I would've bought it way faster. This kind of games was never my type, untill I played Skyrim. This game...Is Skyrim 2, a lovely, immersive masterpiece, I tottally recommend you to buy it. I chose to buy it because first I used FileList, but not long in the story I chosen to give up on the pirated game and buy it on steam, supporting the developers with the little I had because they thruly deserve it. I really feel like I am in the game whyle playing, the graphics are amazing, the ""RPG"" feature feels way more real than any titles with this tag as you have multiple choices in the form of DO or DO NOT do something, compared to Fallout 4 in which you accept a quest in different forms (Straight, Sarcasm,Rude, etc). The sounds are on point, the wildlife, the items being used, the voices and so on. In the end this game, from my perspective can't be called anything else but a MASTERPIECE. There are some things that bother me but I am a perfectionist and there's nothing perfect in the world, didn't expect this aspect from the game but did not expect it to have so few flaws either. There are 21 DLC from which just 3 cost money, but the others are not ""game changing"", just small additions that add up to a greater good, satisfying both Weebs and Noobs. Stopped playing for a reason, as I love this game already I go back to the beginning (on youtube) to better understand the lore. I hope this review helped you in your choice of buying or not buying this game. Thanks for reading. :)",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

724,Posted: July 5,61.3 hrs on record,"I'm going to be honest - at first when I picked this game up during the summer sale I mostly got it because I wanted to see how it performed on my new pc knowing the graphics of the game is very good. However somewhere along the way when I played this I got obsessed, I've only had the game for like 4 days but I've still played around 30 hours, the games quests and content is amazing, the only things I can complain about is the quest system being somewhat weird as you cannot cancel quests (you can just ignore it and switch to another one though) but it remains as an annoyance, another thing I found was that the character would freeze midway while jumping down water sometimes so I'd be forced to load my most recent save, on top of the the quest involving Freya's garden is also quite annoying and unclear at times.This game is great if you're looking for an amazing single-player campaign and it rewards people who aren't linear and instead rewards you for going out of your way to explore (and trust me, there's alot to explore). I also love the fact that it isn't only PvE based but rather a mix of casual playing doing quests to fighting enemies (whether that is through a quest or a product of your curiousity while exploring). I'm so glad I got this, probably one of the best games I've owned, hands down. 9/10",1 person found this review helpful,Recommended

791,Posted: July 5,144.2 hrs on record,"Being a Witcher fan from the beginning (W1, W2 and now W3).  It amazed me how CDPR improved the game each and everytime.  This installment of the Witcher is again so much better than the last.  The graphics are beautiful, the areas that you go into are very atmospheric to such and extent that when you hear something creak in the woods or bubble in the swamp, you immediately freeze, expecting something to jump on you any second.  Voice acting for all the characters is very well done.  The music is at time so haunting that it raises the hair in your neck.  The story being told are so engaging that I need to go and play Witcher 2 again to remember what happend there.  BUT.....  The one thing that I am extremely thankful for is that the devs made a game that still play on my old PC.  This game cruises at 30fps on medium settings with AA!!!  And I have a old PC!!!   Having a chance to enjoy this game and not needing to go and break my piggy bank to buy new hardware is a major plus!!!  Thanks Dev's!!!!",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

939,Posted: July 4,194.0 hrs on record,"The Witcher 3 is one of the best games I have ever played. It took me a while to get into it to be honest (nearly two years lol) but once I finally pushed through that initial barrier, the game just opened up and immersed me like none other.The world, the environments and the graphics are amazing, and they hold up very well after 4+ years (im reviewing this in 2019). The game is based on books which have a very interesting world and lore.The gameplay consists mainly of combat and dialogue and is enjoyable throughout. The enemies are varied and always interesting to fight. Except for wraiths. ♥♥♥♥ wraiths.The music has to be commended as well, at one point I found myself returning to a certain location (Oxenfurt) over and over just to listen to its ambient music.Above all else the story and narrative is so damn good. You really do care for the characters, they are complex and interesting in their own rights, and you feel that the protagonist, Geralt has real, deep relationships with them. Geralt himself goes down as one of the all time best protagonists. What seperates the witcher from other games is that not just the main storyline is well crafted. CDPR have put a lot of effort and attention to detail into each and every side quest, making them at times just as enjoyable as the main quests. This game is frankly amazing, but it still has its flaws. They are definitely minor in comparison to the games many positive aspects, but they are there nonetheless. My biggest problem with the game is technical in nature, namely occasional movement bugs, and tbh I'm not a big fan of one of the main methods of movement in this game, horse riding. Its janky af sometimes. Most of the time its fine though.All in all, The Witcher 3 is one of the best games of all time, and by far the best RPG I have ever played. The story is so lovingly crafted, the characters are well written and voice acted, the world is beautiful, the music is wonderful and the gameplay enjoyable. Both the DLC are great and the second one, Blood and Wine, ties up the end of Geralts story in a beautiful way.It's a crime not to have played this game. Its absolutely worth full price, and if you catch it on sale don't even hesitate to buy it.

990,Posted: July 4,683.4 hrs on record,"This game is amazing, it occasionally has bugs, but they are quite rare. The story is engaging and the story is very easy to follow. I enjoy the combat mechanics as well, though character build doesn't seem to be all that important if you're playing at the 3 lower difficulty levels.",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

997,Posted: July 4,57.9 hrs on record,"I haven't gone though the dlc yet, but the main stroy had so many twists, and made me wish there were somethings I did or didnt do. It was an emotional ride to say the least. I might make a new game before doing the dlc and see how it goes on blood n bones dificulty",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended
998,Posted: July 4,7.4 hrs on record,"Absolutely spectacular game. The story is in-depth and seemingly endless(Over 100 hours of story without exploring). Great graphics, nice combat. Although after a while the combat gets a bit stale and repetitive. But all things considered this game is the best of its generation",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended
