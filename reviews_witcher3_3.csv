8,Posted: July 4,94.8 hrs on record,"To start off, this is my favorite RPG of all-time. So I might be a tiny little bit biased lol.The Story Simply fantastic. Even if you haven't played any of the other Witcher games, you'll be fine. This game puts you up to speed with everything that has happened since then. The characters, the dialogue, and the story is greatly done. As the story escalates you really feel that you have multiple choices to make, so this gives it a whole other layer of intrigue.The CombatIt's good combat - it's fun. There's also a lot of depth to it. There's different oils, elemental runes, and many other things that can vary combat in your favor. It's also rewarding if you play your cards right.The GraphicsOne of the best looking games I've ever played, even in Normal graphics settings. Just the textures and the resolution really give this game the justice it deserves. Truly a sight to behold.In ConclusionSo, this is a simple review, not to tell you that you should maybe buy The Witcher III, but what I am saying is that you should buy this game as you're reading this review. Thanks for reading.",1 person found this review helpful,Recommended

However, I knew I had to try out this game once it was on sale because I was interested on how would my experience go. I amazed on how stunning the graphics hold up today and how rich the story and environment can be. Obviously not playing the other prior Witcher Games, I feel like this game does provide enough information of the previous games. My only issues is that the game does not have consistent FPS (even with NVIDIA Experience's optimized settings) so I it would be nice if you stop using your V-Bucks and start using your parents credit card on a better PC (do so legally of course).

I won't say too much as you might have already read countless reviews praising this masterpiece.I won't talk about the abnormally good quest design.I won't talk about the immensely moving story.I won't talk about the highly immersive world.I won't talk about the rich characters and lore.I won't talk about the way you shape your gameplay through the many choices.I won't talk about the sad feeling you get after finishing the base game.I won't talk about the joy you feel after you realize there's still a ton of content in the DLCs and side quests to complete.I won't talk about the sadness that comes after you've done it all.So, a glaring question,- Is it worth it?ABSOLUTELY YES.

Your decisions in one quest line can effect your options in a completely different questline either limiting the outcomes your stopping progression altogether.The game not only isn't linear, it's not a quest tree either. I guess we could call it a quest ball of wibbly wobbly timey whimey stuff. The characters reference what quests you have done based on the order you do them in and what choices you made during those quests. If characters haven't been met then they won't be referenced. If characters have been killed off then the conversations will change accordingly.

Amateurs...tends to matter by self always making the cause only worse...I must admit i have been lazy in reviewing this amazing piece of art here on steam... i have some solid hours sunk in game to do so properly this time. IS IT THE BEST GAME EVER? well...no.. nothing is... W3 has it's flaws, bugs, and prety much usual things that is a absolute normal thing in EVERY game.. BUT! Is it game that deserves title GOTY? - Oh my YES! YES! CDPR done impressive amount of dedicated work on this masterpiece- one of the most compelling game stories i have ever ( been honored to acommpany and vitness) in a realy long time ( 20+ years) . Visually it is beautiful as it can get ( talking bout VANILLA here, not touching modding aspect of this game) , on par with AAA titles of recent 2 years easily ( Assassin's series, Tomb Raider, Uncharted .. you get the point). As for gameplay mechanics it takes some time to get used to- it's not as fluid as AC series freerun and parkour of watch dogs- but it does the job done. Story of Geralt is what hooks up to this game, his travels and alliances is what makes game an extra appealing when learned about ( Via ingame lore or novels). Npc's and secondary characters make you feel about them ( rly i did rage ( in my case about Vesemir) = fastest quest i've done in years just to deal with a C#ck in heavy metal plates), choises matter... Oh, and the expansions? oh my- i have not seen many developers to improve on their game through those in a while... it's just as icing on a cake.. and CDPR is the dev which cares about us- gamers, not only about hefty amount of money from their half baked game, just to appeal share holders.. ( * cough EA * cough ) Get it here on STEAM or if you are more prone to and do not mind to give your money to rly nice polish developers - on GOG ( money goes straight to CDPR as it is their's launcher DRM free and have all benefits of cloud safe and achievments)",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

The paid dlc's, however, aren't even dlc's IMO. THEY'RE BORDERLINE FULL GAMES. Toussaint is a whole new map included in the blood and wine dlc, with a massive story, and tons of sidequests. While Hearts of Stone, the other dlc, doesn't add a lot of          territory (mapwise) to the game, its still ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. Please for the love of god, purchase this game. This ♥♥♥♥ is god tier.

In this current AAA market this game still holds up and I'd even say it is better than most recent released games. The story is gripping, every choice you make makes you reflect and even have moral dilemmas. If you are a type of person who loves slow paced story's that throw hard hitting subjects at you like politics, racism, war, and love. Then I wholeheartedly recommend this title. On top of that this is just one of the most immersive games I've ever been in, crowds and cities actually feel alive, its not like the dead NPCs in Oblivion or Skyrim. If nothing what I said still convinces you then get it for supporting one of the best studios in the current video game market. CDPR honestly set the bar HIGH for how to ethically give a game to its consumers without a need to take every nickle and dime while also giving us one of the best games in the current generation.

Almost immediately I was encapsulated by its rich story and immersive environment, which left me with an urge of wanting to learn about and experience the world around me even further. To satisfy this I'd use YouTube lore videos to catch up and eventually purchase the first two games.It's one of those addicting games in the sense that you keep telling yourself, ""Just till the end of this quest."" But end up completing an entire side-quest story line (with the odd Witcher contract in between) three hours later.I've sunk many afternoons into this game, and I can certainly say, it's one of my most treasured games.

491,Posted: July 3,33.1 hrs on record,"Amazing, immersive open world, story-driven game with lots of quests and side quests. If you like Skyrim, you'll love this too. The graphics are gorgeous, and the story is very good. There's tons of (fairly long) cut scenes that explain the story as you go. There are some points where you must make a choice, and the choices have consequences. Consequences you discover later as you continue to play. I highly suggest not googling for help on quests, and if you do, take care not to read any spoilers because it will probably ruin the game for you. I find the UI a bit clunky, not a huge fan of how we're supposed to access Geralt's witcher abilities. Fighting can be a little tough at first, but its a good challenge. Excellent game; every gamer from casual to addict should have The Witcher in their collection.",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended
492,Posted: July 3,6.3 hrs on record,"Some of us are not here for the cluttered game mechanics, but somehow even on the ""story only"" mode I still have to deal with them. The combat system is way too busy, with more keybindings for various dodges and attacks than I am inclined to memorize, but if I don't utilize them all then combat becomes very difficult, especially against bosses. Bosses have been a central game mechanic almost since the dawn of video gaming and yet somehow nobody's figured out a better way to implement them beyond giving them a tediously large health bar that I can only chip away at.

My only disappointment with the game is that it doesn't tie well from Witcher 2 in the choices that were made and I'm highly disappointed in not seeing some of the characters, such as Iorveth, in it. I know that his content was removed from the game before release and I just feel that was a big mistake. Witcher 1 and 2 had these elements, where your choices in the game affected the next, but that doesn't seem to be the case here except with Yen and Triss. Overall though, for what it is, it's very enjoyable and I highly recommend it.",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

The story, graphics, game play, combat, dialogue cut scenes, EVERYTHING is amazing. Such a massive open world (Sort of, divided into separate maps) and many side quests that are just as intimate as the main story, a lot of them actually being tied to the main quest, which for once in my gaming experience is a 10/10 story. I was first scared to approach this game because i had never read the books upon which they're based or played any of the previous games. Not to worry though, you will catch up quickly and there is absolutely no need to play any of the previous games to understand this one. There's still so much I can go back and do, including the DLC which I've heard is the length of a full game themselves. Minor complaints about bugs and optimization as this ran smoothly on my PC with few exceptions and bugs.

615,Posted: July 3,35.6 hrs on record,"Best Open World RPG that's currently on PC. The writing is some of the best I've ever seen, however it is a little confusing at the beginning because this is the last game in the trilogy, which is also based on eight novels which were originally written in Polish, so trying to figure out what's happening is hard as hell. Once you get through the first fifteen or so hours; you will love this game, all the characters are interesting, beautiful, funny, and down to Earth. The quests feel like the developers really care about them, instead of just being in the game for a statistic. The DLC's, are masterfully written and detailed and are well-worth your money. The world is filled with things to do, and the acting (for the main/side characters) is amazing! The characters feel so authentic, with the fantastic acting paired with the great detail put into their faces, they feel like real people.The game should take around 100 hours to complete, but I've spent well over the 500 mark (on different platform) and could very easily spend another 500, no problem.

704,Posted: July 3,214.5 hrs on record,"One of the best role-playing games of all time. The story itself is top notch, and even the side quests feel fully fleshed out. There's a hell of a lot to do in The Witcher 3 so it's not for people who can't spare the time to put into it, but none of it feels like a chore. The combat is so smart and fluid. You have to actually consider what you're fighting, prepare appropriately and then engage rather than just mindlessly hack and slash. The music and voice acting is wonderful. And Gwent is one of most addictive and interesting side games within a game I've ever played.The game isn't perfect though. The horse riding can be a bit irritating when Roach just decides to stop mid-gallop. Clearing Skellige is a bit of a chore due to the amount of sea travel (and god damn harpies.) I've had a few crashes but nothing too troublesome. Overall, little niggles but they're worth it for such a high class game.Also, Hearts of Stone is one of the best expansion packs I've ever played. The quests are on another level and it features some of my favourite characters from the whole series.If you have the time for it, I'd highly recommend The Witcher 3. You won't regret it.",1 person found this review helpful,Recommended

729,Posted: July 3,391.7 hrs on record,"One of the best games that's ever been made. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt offers hundreds of hours of game play, a rich, detailed world, and an unforgettable story. Every system in the game reinforces the world around the player. Each quest offers another rewarding sliver of lore, drama, and emotion. The tone of the game is dark, as the ravages of war surround the player, but the devs understand that heartfelt emotions need to be balanced with humor, excitement, and repose. If this is your first game in the Witcher series, you can pick up The Wild Hunt and more or less learn everything you need to know from the characters' writing, interactions, and the rich lore that exists in the game's glossary. This is an absolute must play for anyone who is a fan of RPGs, open worlds, fantasy, and ""hardcore"" gaming. The reason why I say ""hardcore"" is that the game requires you to process a somewhat high level of information and understand several important interconnected mechanics in a way that might turn off more casual players. That is not an insult or a value judgement, but one should know ahead of time that there is a learning curve that might make the game seem confusing or frustrating for the first several hours. Do not worry though, the mechanics are so perfectly tuned that, if you focus and experiment, you'll learn all the game's systems and it will become second nature. Absolute 10/10 GOAT. Go buy it! Go play it!",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

I don't mean to say that those other games aren't worthy, but the Witcher 3 excels in many areas. It looks great, the story is great, the combat and fighting is fun, and the music is enjoyable and fits well with the game.

After 6 months of collecting dust i finally decided to give it a try and oh boy, it was everything i ever hoped for in a game. I instantly fell in love with the story, characters and atmosphere of the beautiful world of the witcher and regreted every moment i decided not to try the game. It really grabs you into the world of geralt and its almost like taking a vacation every time i played. This Game has so much to offer it's been years and ive played through it several times and still manage to enjoythe game from beginning to end and find new things to discover.

773,Posted: July 3,83.4 hrs on record,"straight up.... just wow.This is the best RPG I have ever played. The story was so rich, it kept me at the edge of my chair. I always wanted to know what happened next and THE CHOICES you make will effect the story and the outcome. You know those games where it says the choices you make will effect the game BUT THERE IS ONLY ONE ENDING? Not this game.... (40+ endings) When I finished the main story, I was feeling sentimental because I did not want the game to end yet.The gameplay can be a little repetitive but that's only if you make it repetitive. You have such a wide variety of approaching your enemies. You can brew potions, witcher signs, and etc to give you the upper hand in fights. There is so much to do as Geralt (main character) and you can lose yourself in this beautiful setting. I have ~80 hours logged but I still have so much gameplay left because of the expansions and witcher contracts.The graphics on ultra is goddamn beautiful. If your computer can run it, you can kick back listen to music and adventure around. You know how in GTAV you have this HUGE landscape to explore but there really wasn't much to do. Witcher 3's world is very interactive and you can interact with people and they will give you quests or clues to treasure.Dont be a dumbass like me. Play witcher 2 before you play this game. I would have surely enjoyed the game far more and put more thought into my choices. Some moments happened in the game that I was kind of like....huh? Nonetheless, this game was still amazing to me.I bought this game for 15 dollars but this game IS WORTH $60. This is my greatest purchase from Steam in the past two years. There is so much content you might get  a little overwhelmed but be happy because you have so much to do.SPOILERSSPOILERSSPOILERSSPOILERSSPOILERSSPOILERSSPOILERSSPOILERSSPOILERSI wish you could see everyone at Kaer Morhen after you beat the game.

774,Posted: July 3,55.1 hrs on record,"This is for sure the best game of all time.I highly recommend to get both DLC's as they provide substantially more (post-main) story content. ""Hearts of Stone"" shows how the game has great detail and lore, whereas ""Blood and Wine"" shows off the graphical beauty element of the game. There is no ""micro-transaction""  nonsense, with free alternative options for the game. The base game is exceptional itself and provides hundreds of hours of content, with a vast open world, and a rich, diverse NPC population, there are also all kinds of different types of monsters to engage with. CD PROJEKT RED have created a timeless master piece that has embedded itself into moder pop -culture. Simply put: This game is phenomenal and you certainly should consider buying.

854,Posted: July 3,201.3 hrs on record,"Many AAA-titles are massively overhyped, overmarketed and generally overrated. However, this does not hold for the Witcher. The entire series is a piece of art, and the third installment is no exception. It has masterfully crafted vast open world environments with a writing inspired by slavic mythology, realized through superb voice acting.Combat mechanics are not as tedious as in the last titles, and can be quite a challenge, especially on higher difficulty levels which should be recommended. Normal and easy difficulties may contribute to omissions of some of the finer game mechanics that make the game more interesting.In terms of story, the main quest line is somewhat lackluster, but coherent throughout the series, which should be played in sequence, and takes accumulated player choices into account. However, it is in the side quests and expansions, especially Hearts of Stone, that the Witcher writing truly shines.",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

Ignore steam stats... that was just my 3rd run.For me personally game isnt without its flaws, its sad that this good game even in GOTY edition that came year later still has â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ bugs that most ppl dont even notice like talents not working, broken builds and insanelly bad world scaling.Thankfully there is wonderful modding community that solved soooo many of vanilla game problems that i cant imagine playing Witcher 3 without super heavy overhaul of it. I would suggest anyone to try game with at least ghost mod or W3EEI truly feel sorry for people that never had chance to fall in love with this masterpiece, they are on such lose for it.. if by any chance you are one of those people, please give it another chance with some mods and finish tutorial area (White Orchard) get into Velen and let game take you in and enjoy this unforgettable world, story and characters.",3 people found this review helpful,Recommended

873,Posted: July 3,383.6 hrs on record,After finishing the Witcher 3 it felt like finishing a book you never wanted to end. It took me at least 100-120 hours to finish and throughout these hours I as a player got engrossed into the world and started feeling for even the small side quest characters that may only get 5 min screen time. The side quests were never repetitive and some were so long and immersive that you might forget that it's a side quest and not a main quest. The dlc's were long and different that had it's own charm and did not feel like missions that were cut out of a full game. They had their own unique characters and worlds and stories that make you love CDPR for being a great game company. Can't wait to play their next title Cyberpunk 2077 definitely worth it.I played this game twice and going to play it a third time just because I want to experience this world again.,No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

970,Posted: July 3,29.0 hrs on record,"""They offered me a percentage of their profits. I said, 'No, there will be no profit at all - give me all my money right now! The whole amount. It was stupid. I was stupid enough to leave everything in their hands CD Project Red because I didn't believe in their success. But who could foresee their success? I couldn't."" -Andrzej Sapkowski, Witcher AuthorThe continuation and grand finale to the massively beloved franchise from CD Project Red inspired by the Witcher book series. So Renowned and beloved that it has its own Netflix show and that the original book writer had regretted on selling the rights to the developer. I'm sure I don't have to convince anyone on why they should get this game, if you haven't heard of Witcher 3 then what are you doing right now? GO BUY IT (especially right now when Summer Sale is happening), but really if you love stories with great world building, vibrant characters, weird encounters or mysteries then oh lordy...This game is for you!*Just a side note for the betterment of your overall experience, move pass the first map as soon as you can, the story starts to really pick up after that.*Also, don't bother with the hours that I've played , I bought it during launch on GOG, played many hours and now I've bought it for my steam collection",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended

The only gripes that I have are that combat feels somewhat repetitive after 80 or so hours and load times leave a lot to be desired.

993,Posted: July 3,87.8 hrs on record,"I’m a bit late to the train since I had waited for the price to drop before buying the game, but I have to say that the 20 or so dollars I spent for this game for TOTALLY WORTH IT.Although I have only finished about half of the game, I have already fallen in love with the story, the gameplay, and the world of The Witcher as a whole.Even though I had not played (or even heard of) the two previous Witcher games, the story was so well done and nicely explained that it didn’t matter. I still was able to enjoy the narrative and appreciate it fully. Don’t get me wrong, I am sure that there are a lot of references from the previous games that went completely over my head. What I’m saying is that it is completely fine to try out this game even if you haven’t played the previous installments.Finally, I want to say that I have rarely ever played big open-world RPGs like this game, but I have enjoyed this game so much that I would readily call it one of my favourite games that I have played in a long time.",No one has rated this review as helpful yet,Recommended
